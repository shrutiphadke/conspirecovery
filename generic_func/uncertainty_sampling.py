"""NumPy Uncertainty Sampling examples
The four types of Uncertainty Sampling in this repository are:
Least Confidence: difference between the most confident prediction and 100% confidence
Margin of Confidence: difference between the top two most confident predictions
Ratio of Confidence: ratio between the top two most confident predictions
Entropy: difference between all predictions, as defined by information theory
