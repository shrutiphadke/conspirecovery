34053,34053,QAnonCasualties,ltdai5,3,12,megax454,How can I heal someone else's strong sentiment against Authority?,"Nice to meet you all, I did not know something like this existed, and I appreciate any response from you all.

I want to say that I believe from watching my mother that most of her belief in this kind of ideas comes from her strong rejection of authority, she was raised only by my grandmother, we all love grandma but she has always been very distrustful of anyone trying to ""control"" her, she had some bad experiences with our grandfather and multiple people on her life that left her wanting to be alone and trying to be the only variable that controls her life (and god too), she sees with disgust and distrust people like politicians, cops, rich people, etc anyone that is in a position of more power than her.

My mother is aware of that behavior from my grandmother but she can not see that she carried some of that herself, maybe not in the same way but she has the belief that it's important to protect her individuality from being restricted if my grandmother would refuse to call the police because she doesn't trust men coming to her house even if they could do, god knows what to her daughter, my mother would not be as irrational but would do things like changing her path if police are on sight, even though she is not doing anything wrong, try to go through closed roads even though they are marked as dangerous as not to fall prey in her mind to some sort of sheep mentality, doesn't believe in the Christian God because our grandmother ( which is valid but we can see the resentment towards grandma and she trying to force her religion ).

This even if subtle translates to a lot of things in my mother's life, we all know she does this and nobody looks at it as something dangerous, heck compared to what our grandmother does is nothing. That was before she started watching conspiracy theories with my father.

My father and the rest of the family began to watch this kind of stuff on cable and on the internet and quickly lost interest in the thing but my mother kept on watching it on her phone in her free time, she would comment us this and that and we would just take it as a simple conversation. Now we have begun to worry about her, she refuses to wear a mask, we had to vaccinate our little brother behind her back as not to annoy her. Se didn't go to vote because she said the elections are meaningless now but the thing that worried us the most is that she managed to find people with similar ideas to her and began to go to a club to talk about these conspiracies and they almost went to that rally to ""stop Biden"".

I feel lucky that is not something as severe as it could be, but since we realize the danger that these things can make, I have taken to myself to help her.

But I don't know if is possible for me to help her, every time we try to speak with her she gets defensive and it always goes back and forth into the same thing, she feels she is liberating herself in some way shape, or form and that she can not place her trust on other people and she is constantly looking for some sort of impossible independence from everything.

I didn't know it was a sentiment that came from conspiracies, she has this idea of some utopia without the influence of the massive media (except for the ""alternative media""), without technology (except her phone) with free spirituality (these cheap ""new era"" **enlighten** that these groups tend to sell).  We used to joke with her that that's what grandfather used to have when he was a farmer and he still passed away from drinking his troubles away.

We feel she disconnects more and more from reality and we want to stop it now that is early. any comments would help.

I'd love to hear what someone more educated in neurology, psychiatry, or psychology has to say on the subject, but it honestly feels like some people with paranoid schizophrenia have managed to infect others with it. This is what Dawkins meant when he coined the phrase ""meme"". It's basically the concept of a biological virus, but through the human brain, accomplishes infection via information.

26396,26396,QAnonCasualties,hp1efp,1,5,wyota,My parents are CONVINCED I'm part of Qanon even though I don't believe in any of their nonsense.,"To oversimplify: like the most of the people my age on here, I believe that the Clintons, Bush's, Hollywood and many of the well-connected elite in the US take part in child sex trafficking for financial gain or blackmail: I'm gen Z, I can use the internet, and I can distinguish between reliable sources and the Daily Caller, and my parents essentially believe everything on the internet is conspiracy theories, because they only trust what's on television and literally think websites in general are suspicious (they're older boomers). 
What gets aggravating it's just as clear to me that Qanon is disinformation as it is that the MSM is: the puzzles, the silly ""clues"", everything about Qanon is geared towards maintaining people's attention and entertainment. The goal isn't to give people reliable information, but to release these ""clues"" about elite pedophilia so that Joe 6-pack feels like he's Sherlock Holmes, solving a mystery, even this isn't how real life works. It also conveniently absolves Qanon from responsibility by being proven wrong, since rather than reveal evidence, they reveal those ""clues"" that can be interpreted a million different ways. I've explained this all to you, the people of Reddit, so logically and reasonably, but when I tell thos to my parents, somehow they say ""oh you're less extreme than the *other* members of Qanon"". It's so unbelievably frustrating that my relationship with my parents us totally falling apart, and I used to he so close to them. Listening to them ignore the obvious evils and corruption within our government is as traumatizing as it is for the average person to listen to a ..Qanoner?

My name is Maggie Gottlieb and I'm a producer at WPXI in Pittsburgh.

It's been weighing on me that this dangerous conspiracy theory doesn't just hurt those who follow it, but also their loved ones and, as we saw on Jan. 6, democracy as a whole.

I'm hoping to connect with users from western Pennsylvania who have been impacted by QAnon. The theory itself may be difficult for some of our viewers to understand, but putting your human stories behind it makes it clear as day.

If you're from the Pittsburgh area OR you have a relative or a friend in this area involved in Q, please feel free to email me at [mgottlieb@wpxi.com](mailto:mgottlieb@wpxi.com). If you agree to an interview, we would take all necessary steps to conceal your identity, if you prefer.

39237,39237,QAnonCasualties,p6i5e6,1,43,Snuggle-Muggle,I'm tired of Q'ers only pointing out the death stats.,"They point out how ""few"" people have died. This virus is wreaking more havoc than death. My friend is three weeks in. Hasn't been able to work this whole time. Just changed jobs, and her health insurance hasn't kicked in, nor does she have PTO. Her husband isn't working because he has to care for their son and had to quarantine. That's just one case in which COVID has disrupted a family. Limited medical care, weeks without a paycheck, and ongoing symptoms with no end in sight. 

My cousin is one of those death statistics. Caught the Delta variant from a CHILD whose parents looked the other way when their child got sick because they didn't want to cancel their vacation. My cousin was healthy. Died within 10 days from a blood clot to the brain. The five month old baby in her belly died with her. He was their first son. His father was so excited to be having a boy. Now two little girls have lost their mother and brother. I don't want to even think about how long it will take to pay off the hospital bills. 

Now for me. Haven't caught COVID, but I live in Florida where it is rampant. School is back in session, and I had no way of protecting my 6 year old daughter in a school where the governor has threatened to take away funding from schools that mandate masks. I decided to pay a babysitter $800 a month to watch my daughter and help her with virtual school. My mother just passed unexpectedly (not from COVID), and now I and my immunocompromised sister are helping more with my 71 year old dad who is grieving my mom. I can't chance losing any more family. So here I am paying $8,000 this year to keep my daughter safe at school. That's what it's costing me for a tiny peace of mind.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/p6i5e6/im_tired_of_qers_only_pointing_out_the_death_stats/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/p6i5e6/im_tired_of_qers_only_pointing_out_the_death_stats/,1.0,2021-08-18 02:25:39

BTW, here's a good article about the various theories, including the Russia one: [https://medium.com/@travismview/who-is-really-behind-the-bonkers-qanon-conspiracy-theory-1e2ef1e08da2](https://medium.com/@travismview/who-is-really-behind-the-bonkers-qanon-conspiracy-theory-1e2ef1e08da2)

The (very good) book was *Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia* by Peter Pomerantsev. It's a real eye-opener. I have new appreciation for western democracy after reading about the staggering levels of corruption in Russia.

One thing that the book emphasized is the hero worship of authoritarian leaders in Russia. Not only in the propaganda, either; apparently Russians have a taste for it:

&gt;When the Ostankino channels launch the Russian version of the British TV show Greatest Britons, renamed Name of Russia, it’s meant to be a straightforward PR project to boost the country’s patriotism. The audiences across the nation are to vote for Russia’s greatest heroes. But as the country starts to look for its role models, its fathers, it turns out that every candidate is a tyrant: Ivan the Terrible, founder of Russia proper in the sixteenth century and the first tsar; Peter the Great; Lenin; Stalin. The country seems transfixed in adoration of abusive leaders. When the popular vote starts to come in for Name of Russia, the producers are embarrassed to find Stalin winning.

At one point the author discusses Stalin with a priest:

&gt;“Why Stalin?” I ask. “Didn’t he murder hundreds of thousands of priests?” “We don’t know why he was sent by God. Maybe he had to slaughter them so the faith could be tested. It’s not for us to judge. When you cut out a disease you have to cut out healthy flesh too.”

That's something I've seen from a lot of Trumpists, Qultists or not: if you shove their nose into Trump's debauched behavior, they say that God chose an imperfect tool for His purpose.

There's a lot of propaganda depicting Putin as a heroic warrior. There is even a comic book about him. [https://www.vice.com/en\_uk/article/mvpep8/super-putin-interview-comic-sergey-kalenik](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/mvpep8/super-putin-interview-comic-sergey-kalenik)  (If I didn't hate v/o/x/d/a/y I'd suggest that he publish an English translation of it along with his other alt-right comics. Some of you know he has one coming up that's about Q.)

All of this fits with the hero worship of the authoritarian leader who will be a Daddy to the entire nation which QAnon promotes. If I were setting out to propagandize Americans, I wouldn't have been so overtly authoritarian, I would have thought we wouldn't go for it (sigh), but to Russians it's just what they're used to.

The author quotes some racist remarks he's heard from Russians, and has this to say about a motorcycle gang there:

&gt;The Night Wolves want to rule by themselves, and to keep their own bikers in line they needed their own creed. So they started to build up a nationalist siege mentality. They changed their insignia to Russian and began to spread stories that the Bandidos wanted to flood Russia with drugs. It’s hard to fathom how real the foreign threat to the Night Wolves is. There are thousands of Night Wolves and no more than a few dozen Bandidos in Russia. But to hear Weitz speak of it, they are surrounded.

The xenophobia here is familiar. Not that we don't have homegrown xenophobia, but now that we know Russians on the internet have been cultivating the alt-right, well, it's only natural that they would promote the same nasty tendencies here that they do at home. 

Now for some fake news:

&gt;When you go to check (through friends, news wires, anyone who isn’t Ostankino) to see whether there really are fascists taking over Ukraine or whether there are children being crucified, you find it’s all untrue, and the women who said they saw it all are actually hired extras dressed up as “eye-witnesses,” and the whole line between fact and fiction at Ostankino has become irrelevant.

This just caught my attention because of the belief among Qultists that a lot of shootings and stuff are faked by crisis actors. Again, Russians would create propaganda that followed tropes familiar to them.

&gt;For when I talk to many of my old colleagues who are still working in the ranks of Russian media or in state corporations, they might laugh off all the Holy Russia stuff as so much PR (because everything is PR!), but their triumphant cynicism in turn means they can be made to feel there are conspiracies everywhere: because if nothing is true and all motives are corrupt and no one is to be trusted, doesn’t it mean that some dark hand must be behind everything?

Qultists are incredibly paranoid and refuse to believe anything - except for the conspiracy websites they've decided are legit. I've seen several of them, such as Anonymous Conservative, saying they have no idea what to believe anymore.

And another theme Q and Russian propaganda have in common:

&gt;The weekly news roundup show is on. The well-dressed presenter walks across the well-made set and into shot, briskly summing up the week’s events, all seemingly quite normal. Then suddenly he’ll twirl around to camera 2, and before you know it he’s talking about how the West is sunk in the slough of homosexuality, and only Holy Russia can save the world from Gay-Europa, and how among us all are the fifth columnists, the secret Western spies who dress themselves up as anticorruption activists but are actually all CIA. (Who else would dare to criticize the President?)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Kremlin switches messages at will to its advantage, climbing inside everything: European right-wing nationalists are seduced with an anti-EU message; the Far Left is co-opted with tales of fighting US hegemony; US religious conservatives are convinced by the Kremlin’s fight against homosexuality.

This reminded me of a blog post from a couple of months ago:

[https://gizadeathstar.com/2018/06/a-collusion-of-a-different-sort/](https://gizadeathstar.com/2018/06/a-collusion-of-a-different-sort/)

The site owner, conspiracy author Joseph Farrell, starts by dismissing the possibility of collusion between Trump and Russia, and then hands the mike as it were to a guest blogger:

&gt;*What if - and it is a speculative case - we might be witnessing the faction that elected Trump not politically colluding with Russia, or financially colliding, but rather* ***culturally colluding*** *with them?*What I mean is, as the mainstream Christians in the US are waking up to the dumbed-down culture of darkness they see every day, it seems that with the sudden emphasis on traditional American values being led from the White House, that the US might be on a path to repeat what was done in Russia: restore the rule of law, replace ethics with morality, replace goodness with virtue, reëstablish the arts, and a healthy emphasis on the individual, the family and community. 

Of course, nothing of the sort is actually happening in Russia, but they have a lot of propaganda claiming that it is, and they've been appealing to the alt-right with this pack of lies. And QAnon is also full of Traditional Values talk.

(Incidentally, I find it baffling that Farrell, who believes in an international fascist conspiracy amongst the descendants of Nazis and secret colonies on Mars and the moon, denies the clearly genuine conspiracy of Russia to undermine American democracy and alliances.)

There's two other things that incline me to think QAnon might be Russian. 

1. Whoever's behind this clearly does not care about the US. Damaging it by fooling Americans into supporting a completely unfit president and believing a lot of absurd lies does not trouble Q one bit. I have to think that even an American who wasn't patriotic or socially responsible would still hesitate to wreak this amount of havoc on us. This is a point against QAnon being a US psyop or a 400-lb American sitting on his bed. Russians hostile to America, however, are no doubt rubbing their hands with glee over the idiot 'murricans falling for this QAnonsense.
2. Whoever's behind this does not seem to fear consequences. When their identity is discovered, they might well be charged with a crime. Impersonating a government official is a crime. We all know that sooner or later, one of these nuts is going to go out and shoot somebody, and when they do, Q could be found legally liable. If Q was a private hoaxster, he probably would have stopped a while ago, like when that Qultist showed up on Hoover Dam with a gun, out of fear of legal jeopardy. Now, if Q is a US psyop by the CIA or NSA or something, then they wouldn't have to worry much about that because they're acting under gummint orders, but again, it seems unlikely to me that a US intelligence agency would damage the US in this particular way. But if it's a Russian psyop, well, it's not like Russia's going to let us extradite the spooks they had messing with gullible Americans.

The full truth remains to be seen, but this is where my money is.

Btw, I researched the claim about Bronfman and it appears she did attempt to illegally donate to Hillary Clinton‘s campaign in 2008. But there is no documentation I can find that alleges Bronfman or Raniere ever donated to the Clinton Foundation. This is what the Qultists do.

I just read a post about what to say to those who got caught up in the spiritually aspect of Q and loved it, because I think the worst thing about Q Anon in my experience is how it preys on very devout Christian people, like my mom and dad. Here’s my story:

My dad has been following Pizzagate since it broke in 2016. He told me a lot about it but i never really worried about it until I got stuck in a conspiracy theory vortex (not quite Q, but definitely did a lot of reading about pizzagate and the “cabal,” which terrified me) when the quarantine started. I got myself out of it, through a lot of meditation and research but my parents are still sort of on the Q train. The thing that they’re really scared about though is the Cabal and the NWO, which my dad really believes is eventually going to persecute and kill Christians. I don’t know how to talk to him about it; he believes it so fiercely and is so afraid that sometimes I end up losing myself and having to recentar myself so that I don’t fall back down into the same hole, if that makes sense.

I was just wondering if there was anyone else who could sort of speak to this. I’m very glad to have found this sub. No one else I know is very well-versed in Q Anon, they all think it’s nothing but a bunch of racists, but in my experience it’s at least in part a group of religious people who are literally being presented with an apocalyptic scenario.

2791,2791,Qult_Headquarters,elglmz,1,4,Yakhov,Divergent theories on the assassination coming from MAGA,"I checked into to lunatic fringe radio/podcast 'Ground Zero'  last night,  whom the host, Clyde Lewis claims Trump listens to, and apparently there is a growing rift between anti war MAGA and the Qultists.  

The \*normie\* Trumpers (if thats even possible) are saying Trump didn't give the order to kill Soleimani. They think it was the deepstate Neocon Intel crew headed by Pompeo and the Generals that conspired to get Trump into a war. THey are saying the letter is evidence of Trump trying to pull out but that he's having to go along with it to save face and look like he's in control.  

The, confused Qultists who haven't got any crumbs to follow on this yet, in their typical Trump is God belief system, are saying that this was all part of Trump's plan to get the military out of Iraq. They say he won't take further action and use this as an excuse to pull out.  Trump could then claim the Dems want us to stay if they oppose the pull out or something like that. 

What's interesting is that they both arrive at the same place in terms of the military staying in Iran. One group blames the Neocon deepstate for twisting Trumps arm to keep us in and he really wants to pull out, the other claims it was all Trump manipulation to pull out but that the Dems aren't going to let him. 

THere seems to be a real rift forming in his base. THe Anons need to see Trump as a hero and the MAGA expected a pull out.  TO them this is starting to look like what it is, Trump using a war to get reelected like Bush did and Trump actually being just another Neocon, so they are making an excuse they hope he will adopt. 

The announcement of the now 2nd largest oil field discovered in Iran 2 months ago would be the most obvious reason the Neocons got Trump on board. THe Petro Industry demands price control over $50 a barrel to make the extremely dirty practice of shale fraking profitable. Iran can turn on the oil faucet and tank the Neocons who run that industry. With a war, they have an excuse for an embargo. This is simple math and the fact that MSM has totally back paged this huge part of the story IMO proves it's at the heart of the matter. Echoes of MSM ignoring the Epstein case in 2011 or when they totally ignored the lack of evidence for Bush's war.

So depending on which narrative Trump hears loudest we will know which faction of MAGA he's more afraid of. My guess is he bends to Neocons while beating the drum of xenophobia, gun rights, abortion, and religious fundamentalism to rally the disillusioned MAGA back around him.  Will they fall for it again?  We know the ANons will, and the kompromised GOP is afraid of Trump so they fall in line. But the standard MAGA that believed Trump was going to bring the troops home, who many are their family members, are a harder sell.  A smart Dem would be calling loudly for a pull out.  Biden won't do that, Pete won't, Bernie will, Liz maybe.",True,self.Qult_Headquarters,https://www.reddit.com/r/Qult_Headquarters/comments/elglmz/divergent_theories_on_the_assassination_coming/,/r/Qult_Headquarters/comments/elglmz/divergent_theories_on_the_assassination_coming/,-1.0,2020-01-07 19:47:42

He's already sent four emails this week telling me not to get the vaccine. I am a teacher so will be in line to get it at the end of the month (probably) and I told him that. He was like (paraphrasing here) oh yeah well you're an adult you can make your own decisions but you're a SHEEPLE. The evidence he sent me for the vaccine supposedly killing people had only examples of older people who had passed away after receiving the first shot or something like that. His source was The Epoch Times so I guess I shouldn't take it too seriously. 

My question is even if it is a created psyops ChiCom conspiracy, he admits that it is killing people? How do the Q people want to cure it??? I mean I guess I know the answer to this one sort of but anyone out there experiencing this headache of logic? At this point, I don't even understand where the Q people are anymore since they've had to cognitive dissonance themselves into oblivion. 

At the same time, part of me feels really sad for him. What's he going to do when he realizes none of this is real? When the National Guard doesn't go out and arrest Biden how will they explain it all away?

The two biggest anti-vax videos circulating around the internet these days come from these two fake doctors. 

The “Doctors”:
Dr. Sean Brooks claims to have a PhD from Oxford. In reality he is a man living in Oxford, Ohio with an online degree in *education* from a school called Walden Online. He never worked in a hospital or research facility. 

Dr. Paul Kangas got his degree online from Clayton Medical Colony which was a non-accredited “distance learning” school in Alabama, which was permanently shut down by a lawsuit in the same year he got his ‘degree’ in 2010. 

Sean Brooks and Paul Kangas are publicly spreading vaccine misinformation. However, instead of sharing their own data and thoughts on the Covid vaccine, they both read from an identical script that they claim originated from Dr. Robert Malone:
“The vaccinated to die in 6 months to 3-5 years:
1. Immunity decreases by 35%
2. Antibody independent enhancement causes organ failure
3. Blood clotting”
They also attribute this quote to Dr. Malone:
“No one should take these jabs ever under any circumstance whatsoever”

They claim Dr. Robert Malone invented MRNA vaccine technology. In reality Dr. Malone did not invent the MRNA but simply wrote some papers on the possibilities of MRNA vaccines in 1989. Countless others have developed MRNA vaccines but Dr. Malone himself did not. 

Dr. Robert Malone never actually said any of what Sean Brooks and Paul Kangas claim he has said. Dr. Malone has distanced himself from these claims made by Brooks and Kangas, and is a public and outspoken supporter of vaccinations for Covid. He had the Moderna jab himself.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/pj6t4t/debunking_one_of_the_biggest_sources_of_antivax/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/pj6t4t/debunking_one_of_the_biggest_sources_of_antivax/,1.0,2021-09-06 19:40:31

But as we all know, Trump sure as hell won't shut up about his baseless voter fraud claims.

I feel like I am living in an alternate universe. The worst part is there are so many people who believe the lies.

Anyway, I am sure that Q will be feeding his followers all kinds of stories about the cabal and election fraud.

But as it becomes more apparent Joe Biden is going to be sworn in a POTUS January 20th, how do you think Q followers are going to reconcile with reality? 

They don't live in reality anyway so Q could just go on as normal. Like maybe Q will say Trump installed Biden as a puppet and is really running thing from the shadows.

Its painful to see where he is going. He has always been silly and a bit naive. I'm a year older and have always played the role of a bigger bro. I first became aware of his views about 3 years ago after we spoke and I learned he favored Trump and was heavy into conspiracies. I knew he had Republican leanings but was still surprised. Since then I've debated him off and on trying to appeal to his logic. I've had little to no success. I believe he first started with Alex Jones. Now he is on lizard people level of QAnon and he thinks Antifa and blm stormed the capital. I could go on forever with all the stuff he has told me.

Anyway a month or so ago I stumbled upon a PBS documentary that helps explain the science of how our loved ones brains got hacked and I wanted to share. I hope this helps explain how it happened if you haven't already seen it.

11653,11653,Qult_Headquarters,ky56w2,5,28,TeacherEdward1,Hello,"I've been wanting to explain this for awhile, but I didn't think anyone would understand. My brother came home from the Navy when I was in my junior year of high school in1996. He told me his experience in the Navy had confirmed his suspicion that the US government was evil. He had some books he had found back then on the JFK assassination, and theories of ancient advanced civilizations. It intrigued me greatly, as I had saw ads for conspiracy magazines and books in the back of High Times magazine. It was stuff about MKUltra and the Iran Contra Scandal. 

Fast forward a couple of years, and I remember having my first experience in front of google. I didn't know what I ought to search for, but for whatever reason, I chose conspiracies. I was hooked.

To make a long story short, I sort of took it suspiciously, but at some point I had become a true believer of some extent. I read so much; all the hits such as the Rothschilds and Shapeshifting Lizards. I was a big Alex Jones follower. 

The thing I'm trying to get across in this last paragraph, is that I didn't necessarily believe in Jones, I figured he had his own mistakes, beliefs, and politics. I didn't have to hold these same views to agree with his general disposition about conspiracies. I believed his research was useful. I became so enthralled, even stuff as nonsensical as David Icke seemed worthwhile. I hate to admit I almost bought one of Icke's books. 

While I was researching conspiracies, I was also going to college and ironically learning basic critical thinking skills. The cognitive dissonance became unbearable.

I remember my dorm room having skyscraper stacks of government FOIA docs laying everywhere. Rareties such as a Phillip Drew first edition adorned my surrounding. Sitting  there, I went over the same Jone's documentary I had been working on. He made a point, I paused the video, jumped across the floor and grabbed the text he was referencing. He lied. What he said the FOIA document said wasn't there. I looked again, then again. Still, I said to myself he was just exaggerating to make a point. 

This kept happening and the lies piled up. It's funny at the time I kept trying to convince myself it was worthwhile to keep track of all this. Sadly, I didn't. At some point I couldn't handle the burden on my mind anymore. I paused one of his videos that I had caught him in a blatant lie in, and played it over several times. Like a ton of bricks it hit me: he was acting. 

Embarrassingly, one day Alex Jones came up in conversation. A friend of a friend said, ""I don't see how anyone could take this guy seriously with his voice."" Like a viel being lifted, I suddenly realized this whole time he had been speaking in a 1950s propaganda voice. Was I hypnotized to some extent? 

I started thinking about how sophisticated Alex Jone's con was, and same as Icke. Alex Jones called Icke a grifter, then had him on his show a year later or so. I was pissed. I wanted to expose these people. I once saw a video of a conspiracy convention, where like a carnival, conflicting conspiracy theorists travelled around peddling supliments and books. I felt like a fool.

I tried to tell people that people like David Icke specifically were much more sophisticated than they appeared at face value. I said he's not crazy, he's a calculated con artist developing a dangerous cult. People laughed at me. 

I went back to the world of conspiracies, and found others had reached the same conclusions. At that time, I think around 2005 many people were calling Alex Jones a ""disinformation agent."" At this time I hadn't watched the gay frogs video. I'm not sure when that came out. 

I tried to explain to people that there was something behind the conspiracies, and that the people pushing them were doing something manipulative. I was laughed at several times. It was said more than once I had gone conspiracy crazy, and that I believed in a ""conspiracy of conspiracies"". A compounded version of what was already a joke. 

When the information came out the Koch brothers had been pushing far right conspiracies in the tea part crowd, I thought ok, that's something. I tried explaining this to people, but was still laughed at for mentioning people like Alex 'gay frogs' Jones, and David 'Lizard' Icke. 

I knew something sinister was behind this mass of conspiracies spreading across the net. I just didn't know who or what. When Trump came out, and start using conspiracy dog whistles, I tried warning people, but again, no one was taking as seriously as what has come about. And this was in Portland, Oregon. 

I stated calling Trump out on cultism during his first election campaign. It was exposed that he was running a real estate, fake cult school and seminar series prior. I knew this was what was happening. I will state now, a theory I've discovered, and is falsifiable: the large majority of cults are based on conspiracies. 

I wanted to know who was behind all this, and I've been wait g for Years. When the mainstream media reported that foreign countries were flooding the net with conspiracies, I felt like I was finally getting an answer. Then the Cambridge Anylitica scandal came out. I knew it was coming from multiple places.

How does it work? To understand, you must study a couple things. One, of course is myth and ritual and how it is used by cults. This is obvious. What is less is that there is a science to this. It isn't under the regular paradigm of objectivism. To understand it, you must study ethnography. 

Ethnography is the method of identifying trends in culture. Culture is always changing do objectivism doesn't work. The new advanced methods are based in the paradigm of constructionist. This isn't bad, it just depends what it's used for. 

The new method of cultism seems to be to track the culture of conspiracies as they form organically online and then have agendas parallel them. An easy way to understand this can be summed in this hypothetical example: if on the news, the anchor has a yellow shirt on, and another a green one, which ever anchor is perceived by audiences as being more so a reliable soice of information will set the standard of shirt color worn on air. Because there isn't a objectively correct color, and these trends always change arbitrarily, there needs to be a method to follow and identify these trends, hence ethnography. You could identify which shirt color is the best, then use that as a marketing tool. 

This is somewhat sophisticated, but really it's a sort of digital parlor trick being used. My suspicion is that this type of mind fuckery is flimsy. I can't imagine many people being manipulated this way wont realize it. I did. I realized I had been duped, wasted countless hours, and had embarrased myself. 

In the end I was pissed, and have an intense amount of anger against these cult leaders. Now I hope our system will do what's necessary and identify them as terrorists. 

Finally, I want to bring attention to Micheal Jaco, a small time conspiracy grifter who pushed the insurrection. He has a YouTube where he uses Q conspiracies to create a market, him and his grifter buddies then try to sell overpriced supplements, and other fake products. For example they appeared to be selling what would be 4 dollars worth of Apple Cidar Vingar for 30 or 40 bucks. I like AVC, but clearly this is a scam.

But since covid it’s now unliveable, he’s convinced covid is fake (I’m a frontline health worker so that’s been difficult 🙄) and with all his furlough time on his hands he’s ended up deep in qanon. He’s gone from the kindest, chilled man to constant anger and major depression. I’m at a loss, not so easy to walk away either, been together 20 years, married 14, 2 kids under 10, mortgage.

My friend denies he's a Q but follows Q line for line. He sends me countless videos and goes on and on about conspiracies( Biden clone, Vaccines, magnets...). I've tried to debunk with reliable sources, show compassion, directly calling bs and now I've decided to go nutty!

I've decided to out crazy him and so far its been hilarious. I made up a squirrel conspiracy inspired by the Rick and Morty episode. The episode has a clip with squirrels talking about destabilizing governments and Morty over hearing them. 

So now anything thing he send me I put an even nuttier twist on it, claiming the squirrels are in control. Example: He says ""Biden is a clone."" I say ""Yes, and Trump too. The squirrels did it! That's why Trump didnt let people take the virus seriously but took the vaccine himself!!! (My Q anti vax of course). 

I've been telling him to avoid trees until June 25th (random date) and stock up on peanut butter to appease the squirrels once they take over lol. I send him hour long documentaries about squirrels that I know he won't watch but I claim that they say something about the squirrel conspiracy. I even found a news report from a few months ago with aggressive squirrels attacking people. 

He brushes my theory off and even laughs about it. Which is much better than him being serious about his nonsense. He says I'm being ridiculous but I just parallel his non logical beliefs and use his own words. I have not broke from character to give him the knowledge that I'm actually joking. Luckily our communications are all thru text so I don't have to keep a straight face cause l die laugh coming up with my response! 

Anyway, that's what I'm doing now. So far I believe its blunted his energy to argue his theories with me. Maybe its causing him to have some perspective. Hopefully he tries to prove I'm wrong, which might make him turn on his logic. As of now, I'm just happy to bring some humor back into our friendship. Feel free to share the Squirrel theory. Good luck with your Q!

34313,34313,QAnonCasualties,m1hui4,1,6,XxxemokidxxxX,Anyone else estranged from their Q?,"I am an only child in my whole family and raised by a single nMom. My aunt and uncles were more like brothers and sisters. I have some very good memories with all of them, including my nMom. However, there is a lot of emotional and (some) physical abuse.

Even after growing up and leaving my home, my mom has always been very emotionally manipulated. She is like clockwork with her love-bombing and making me &amp; my husband feel safe to connect with her, then she just turns on me. She even tries to act like a victim to my husband (who doesn't buy into it).

I went no contact last year for 7 months, but eventually caved from the guilt and sadness of being estranged. [More backstory about what has recently happened with my nMom and aunt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/m0u360/i_got_the_nerve_to_block_my_nmom_aunt_and_now_my/) Since inauguration day (when I had a blow-out fight with my mom), I haven't talked to her. Both nMom and Aunt tried to reach out to my husband to wish him happy birthday and are now acting worried because they haven't heard from us (we blocked them on our phones).

How do I deal with hating and loving my nMom at the same time? I know I can't have her drama and manipulation in my life anymore, but I desperately miss the mom I wish I had (and sometimes have when she's ""good""). She's just so borderline/bipolar and it's so much chaos and controlling. I know if something happened to her during me being estranged it would just eat me up.

33818,33818,QAnonCasualties,lqddb7,11,10,Successful-Career-96,Family member told other family member to not get vaccine,"Hi so one of my family members a few months ago was diagnosed with cancer, she is going to most likely be fine thank God. Her doctors said that she should 100% get the vaccine. 

She was all for it, until recently. Another one of my family members is in college, and when she graduates she is going to be a nurse, and she had the bright idea to tell someone who has cancer to not get the vaccine.  It still shocks me while typing it. 

I don’t know how much this is Q related, but I’m thinking it has something to do it. This family member is a huge Trump supporter, a lot of my family likes him but she’s extreme, and months back I remember her talking about the sex trafficking, and she also thinks Michelle Obama is a man (idk if that’s related to Q but it sounds like something they would say). She was planning on going to the capitol as well, but I forget why she didn’t end up going. She also said that COVID would go away once the election was over, again this is someone who is going to be a nurse. 

So now my family member is skeptical regarding on if she should get the vaccine or not, I think she’ll end up getting it, but it’s still scary to think about. 

I really can not believe that someone who is going to be a nurse, would advise this.

Anyway, over a phone call, i decided to tell my Q-ball dad that his enitire family was vaccinated. He started crying. Bawling, over the phone. I thought he was joking at first, because i told him ""not to be a drama queen"". He used to be a person who'd do stuff like that intentionally, in a very punny dad-esque way. 

He said that 2 years later, there'll be side effects (wow very specific). And said he'll be praying that he's wrong. I said I'm glad, he should pray that he's wrong. Then I ask if anything of Q has come true, and he said nothing yet. I wonder if I'll have to wait 2 more years then at the minimum? 

When I came home for a bit months earlier, I overheard him praying to some Q support group video call -or something- that ""the truth would be revealed to us"". I told my mom about it (who is aetheist), and she criticized him that prayers shouldn't be about bullshit like that (if she was religious). I'm inclined to agree. 

I still love my dad, and he hasn't done anything crazy or hurtful, other than just be mildly offensive occasionally and spamming his family with messages about Q until we threatened to block him. I mostly call him just to say i love him, and make sure he's okay. All the suicides months earlier scared me a bit. He'll pray that ""we'll see the truth"" and i just tell him the same exact thing, haha. I kinda glad he's in some sort of Q group. I can't get him out, i tried.

So yesterday, I finally got the rest of my belongings back. She had left them on the porch outside. I drove by the house, saw her car in the driveway, and had a literal physical reaction and couldn't stop. I was truly terrified. I was finally able to go back and retrieve my belongings when I brought a Sheriff with me just to keep an eye. I had all my remaining stuff loaded into my vehicle in less than 5 minutes. I was literally racing. When the sheriff and I both left, I didn't even make it to the end of the street before I blocked her number. I later went to my parents' house where it was quiet, and passed out for 4 hours from exhaustion and finally peace &amp; quiet.

I still hope she's ok, but there's no way in hell I want to be back there. My body literally had a visceral reaction to being there. I can't go back, nor will I.

I've been in constant contact with my therapist and attempting to rediscover reality, and how to deprogram.

It's all the same format. But up until 4 days ago it was a vietnamese travel/food/language learning vlog channel. And since then, they upload a video once per hour in this weird ass format, and they upload it as a live broadcast. The videos have tens of thousands of views.

Every video has a looping gif of a clip art lion's walk cycle in the top left, and every video had narration with subtitles and a person in front of the video, but they're not even actually narrating. It's just a looping cycle of some person mouthing words and hand gestures that don't match the narration.

Many of the commenters support the content here, and it's disheartening to see. Some are skeptical but still believe.

He also seems to believe in things like the Hunter Biden laptop and more.

Ive seen a lot of posts from people who are saying they feel for their friend and family who have been duped, and I wanted to add my voice to that chorus. My parents are both into Q (my dad more than my mom), and the compelling part about it for them is the religious thread that sort of goes through the Q drops I guess. They both believe very strongly in the satanic deep state. So now that no one has been arrested my Dad thinks that the NWO is coming and that anyone who is a Christian will be persecuted and killed by the government. This is the thing that makes me angriest about Q: the way it sort of preys on very devout people’s belief that they are living in the End Times. I know it’s a ridiculous thing to believe but when I put myself in my parents’ shoes I get overwhelmingly sad for them because they are both literally SO SCARED of what is going to happen to them now. They live a couple states away from me so I haven’t seen them recently, we talk on the phone every week so I will hear from them soon but the last I heard from them was when my mom sent me a podcast at 4am a few nights ago with a guy saying that Biden was going to surrender the country to China as soon as he was sworn in and initiate WWIII. Obviously that didn’t happen, so i guess they’re relieved. I’m scared to ask them about it. I’m just not really sure how to talk to them about anything that isn’t surface level right now. My dad has a habit of bringing all of our conversations back to the deep state in some way. It would be funny, except it’s not funny at all. It’s really sad to me because they can’t enjoy life.

A few people told me they’re afraid to wear something with my organization’s name and logo on it or talk about it with others because they’re scared people will think it is QAnon. This is an example of what this nonsense has done to actual anti-trafficking efforts. Sane people are afraid to openly support the real cause because they don’t want to potentially be associated with Qunacy. The Qult has also mislead well-meaning people into believing nonsense about what human trafficking actually looks like, so they don’t know how to be supportive in a helpful way. Trafficking helplines are having difficulty helping real victims because they’re getting stupid calls about politicians. They have DECREASED awareness of the real problem by putting their stupid politically motivated BS out there. 

Those who started QAnon, and those who know better and enable it for personal gain have harmed real victims. Trump, for example, had the largest platform in the world for 4 years. If he actually gave a damn about helping children he would have denounced QAnon and educated the world about real human trafficking. I personally have tried to educate Qultists, but when I try to explain how trafficking actually happens the conversation ends. They don’t care. I see them harassing real survivors on social media constantly. But then they gaslight you by saying you’re pro-child trafficking if you don’t buy into their lunacy.

I am not in the USA. I have family there on the east coast. They are republican through and through. If Jesus resurrected and went for the presidency as a Democrat, they'd still vote against him. They are allowed to do that. I never had an issue with them being Reps because we rarely spoke politics. I lived with them for a while and besides the odd comment at the news, no major politics between us. I was also in a country for a hot second compared to them who have lived there for their entire lives. 

Trump was a godsend to them. Gave a certain family member the confidence to keep up their trolling online behavior. They looovve getting into fights online before all of this trump shit and loved triggering people. I knew this and didn't approve but they are an adult and has a major attitude issue. I dont know if they are diagnosed with anything but it seems to flip and switch majorly during high-stress situations. It's like a bucking bronco at certain points I witnessed. 

Then all this hit. They had a newborn. I understand the frustration of all the rules and restrictions when you're trying to get your kid to socialize and develop normally. I get being wary of the vaccines because it has been rushed compared to others. I get all the worry.

It's when the other excuses and ""proof"" come into play, my ears just want to fall off. It's infiltrated my own country now and I dont entertain it at all. ""Ah sure let them off"", no I'm going to say what they're saying is bullshit crazy mad, stemming from them being annoyed that they can't go into a shop without a mask. Get over it Beverly it's a literal piece of fabric. I understand it if the USA government were making people were these specific masks you could only buy from them or whatever, yeah be kind of spooked by that but you can make them out of your own pants?!

This person in my family snapped at me last year when I posted a tik tok of a firefighter debunking a girl spouting absolute bullshit about the fires in the west.

*""Why do the fires stop suddenly at the Canadian Border????""* Because you're looking at a USA-only map...typical.

*""Why are the media only focusing on the gender reveal party starting this fire??""* Because it's ridiculous and sensational...someone being a dickhead arsonist or lightning starting fires arent as interesting sadly. 

Those are literally the two I had an issue with because they are ridiculous.

That's the first ""oh no"" moment I had. I never thought they would snap at me like I was their kid. I thought we were closer than that. I didn't reply and I didn't react to anything of theirs online like normal since. Reposting their dog or kid once or twice since. They posted a meme the other week showing brainwaves. I know they are called alpha, omega, beta etc. The Delta brainwave apparently means your brain dead. They think that is what the Delta variant is doing to us, that if you believe in it, you're braindead. I wanted so badly to message *""NO it's BECAUSE RACIST IDIOTS CAN'T STOP ATTACKING PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THEY COME FROM THE VARIANT NAME YOU FUCKING IDIOT.* But that would crack open a can of worms and id be the bad guy. 

Then last night. I posted a meme about how our government is dealing with restrictions arse ways. They ask oh whats the restrictions like there now? I list it out and they ask about travel. Certain countries are still on a list where you need to quarantine for 14/10 days before being let out. 

""It's so wrong. My mum has the Juice and she has to quarantine for 5 days if she wants to visit your mum"", I agreed that it's a balls since their mum was vaccinated a while back that she has to quarantine but ... it's 5 days, be lucky it's not 14. I dont comment on it but I do agree it's assways. I mention the government here hasn't given the heads up to the airports about the new European passport thing that's going on. A QR code that proves you're vaccinated 

""oh here comes nazi Germany. Wear a yellow star if you're not vaccd!"" 

I threw my phone across the room. Germany literally has nothing to do with his now as much as this is NOTHING like the holocaust. 

*""I am not comparing this to the holocaust because that was much much worse. I just want the majority of us to be vaccinated so we and the vulnerable in society can go out and about without fear. People staying indoors on the internet is doing nobody good"",* 

Still haven't gotten a reply. Good, I'm not entertaining them anymore or letting this shit slide because they are at this level. I was upset when they snapped at me last year and this is just another swing and a miss. I actually had tears in my eyes last night stress crying or whatever. I am close with the rest of their family so much and they are making me want to push away. 

It's breaking my heart that not one person close to them has stopped and gone...*y'know what you're saying is nuts right?* But sure that's the downfall of all of our Q friends and family, they think they are after cracking the code and are in the inner circle because they know better. They have answers for everything. Mixing with the troll aspect of their personality, they always fall back on the ""stop hitting yourself!"" mentality. And *you're dumb for being frustrated about being confronted with these facts lol*

I finally realized in the last few years that what my siblings and I experienced growing up was emotional abuse. My mom is a deeply wounded person. She had a tumultuous upbringing, lost father to alcohol as a teenager, and she got stuck in that emotional state. Later, she would use her children in place of a therapist while also berating them in hateful screaming tirades, which numbered in the hundreds and which she doesn't remember. My dad does not understand emotions. He's pretty simple, and he just kinda let it all happen. He thinks that women are just like that. They're christians and have a biblically reduced perspective when it comes to sex and gender.  


I think conspiracy theories have always been an addiction she used to fill the void. I remember one time when she spent weeks following dark-skinned taxi drivers around cause she thought they were part of some terrorist plot. According to her they were never working and their phone numbers were tied to shady locations, which she reported to the FBI.   


Anyway, I went through a brief libertarian, info-wars period in my teens and I remember telling her that I thought the September 11, 2001 attacks were an inside job, and I feel so guilty all these years later because I feel like she took that and ran with it. Both of them got warped by decades of FOX, but it was only recently that I learned how insane their beliefs are (satanic global elites feasting on children/ trump is somehow the solution/mass shootings are deep state operations to erode the 2nd amendment/ infinity etc.). When I heard them say this stuff, I don't know why but it felt like someone turned the lights on in a dark room for the first time. Like I could always kind of see, but now I can see clearly. I remember a teacher telling me that they were crazy when I was 16 or 17, and I feel like he was giving me a gift for the future.   


I don't know if they follow Qanon specifically, they aren't tech savvy, but my mom said something like ""I don't need to follow Q, I knew all of that stuff already"". I've been telling myself that this whole thing is a way for them to ignore the actual in-your-face atrocities of late-stage capitalism, while supporting right wing initiatives and feeling like they still have sound morals.  


IDK, it's just kind of left me feeling adrift. I guess it's like fresh pain realizing how truly fucked up my childhood experiences were. I don't really want to get into all of it but it was volatile and full of manipulation. I struggle with suicidal depression, and this has been a really difficult time (I'm getting help, I'm not at-risk). I know it has been really difficult for my partner cause I've just been vacant and unable to see a future. My partner has been incredibly patient, understanding, and resilient.   


Coming to understand who my parents are, and realizing that they feel vindicated by have millions of co-believers - I just feel adrift.

&gt;We as Anons need to push this narrative. We may not have control over what is happening behind the scenes but we could indeed push the media towards asking POTUS the ""Q"" question.

If we could organize peaceful protests, (yellow vests) in big cities, government buildings and state capitols, it would take no time to get the question asked. Eventually they have to ask the question and once that happens POTUS will have to answer one way or another.

Assuming that QAnon is real, at the level of POTUS disinformation really would be necessary. Trump couldn't admit to Q's plan anymore than he could admit to a secret planned military attack. It would be treasonous. It looks like Qultists want that. 

It would be the worst strategical move possible because it would be telling the bad guys to go run for cover immediately. Trump lies so often that he has no credibility with hardly anyone anymore anyway.

In retrospective, it's probably a good thing Qultists are leaving all the planning to Q.

31211,31211,QAnonCasualties,kz9vg8,1,4,PurpleCat674,QAnon parents,"Hi, I’m mentally exhausted from dealing with my Q parents. My parents have always been into conspiracy theories but in recent years, they have been spiralling deep into QAnon. Things have been getting worse due to the pandemic which they claim is a hoax and a “cleansing” in order for the new world order to take over and enforce their satanic laws upon us all and that vaccines cause autism and are Bill Gates way of micro chipping the world in order for them to create an army. Oh! And that masks are a method of oppression that cause you to breathe in CO2 which kills you. This along with Joe Biden’s win at the 2020 elections which they claim is fake and that Trump will forever be their president which is ironic seeing as they are immigrants who live in the UK. 

Me and my younger sister have been disagreeing with them and calling them out for sprouting lies which only results in arguments where they don’t even acknowledge our argument but state that they know everything from reliable, alternative sources and that we are brainwashed democrats that will one day see the light when we are older. It got to the point where my father began interrogating me on what I though of BLM and antifa which ended up with me crying my eyes out because he told me he does not believe in human rights for everyone and that those who disobey Trump should get shot. He’s always been racist and anti-Semitic and we had argued about this before in which I nearly got kicked out for calling them out. 

I am just so tired of dealing with them. No matter how hard I try, it’s like talking to a brick wall and because of quarantine I cannot escape to go to my friends or even school.

29492,29492,QAnonCasualties,kd0erf,1,29,beautyvenom,My Qmom has been texting me all week about a potential lockdown / cyber attack. Need some reassurance...,"So I am not quite sure what to think or make of this, but my mom texted me a few days ago saying that there is going to be 10 day lockdown and to be prepared with plenty of food and water and that some weird things are going down.  My mom has been knee deep in all of this Q stuff and this isn't the first time she has warned me about a potential lockdown like this.  None of it has come true obviously except for you know, the pandemic lockdown.  I didn't really want to open up a dialog with her.. I was planning on just saying, ""Okay I'll prepare"" just to prevent an argument.  But curiosity got the better of me so I asked her what is going down exactly.  Oops.  Damn myself.  Sure enough, my phone got blown up by all sorts of pictures and links to youtube videos talking about how there is going to be 10 days of darkness starting today, the 14th and that all communications are cut off but not power.  It will be a period where the military will take down all of the ""corrupt"" people.  She was also talking about how when Trump announced that the vaccines were to be delivered, that he kept calling it FISA instead of Pfizer vaccine and I guess the Q folk are coming up with all sorts of theories for that one.  She also went on about how General Perna went on about D-day and how he said that today is the beginning of the end.  I guess they are all trying to make that into meaning that there will be some sort of military takeover and saving America.  I was just screaming inside the entire time I was reading all of this.  So I didn't say much.. just kept it light and made it sound like I somewhat entertained her with all of this. 

Okay so after all of that, she texted me AGAIN last night saying that now they are saying that there is going to be a Cyber attack and they are saying it will be a lot worse than the COVID-19 pandemic (that my Qmom doesn't believe in) and they are calling it the Cyber Pandemic.  It could be big enough to stop our power supply and she is telling me to be prepared with plenty of food, water, candles, flashlights, and all sorts of stuff to survive this.

I really don't know what to think of all this.  My mind is going crazy.  On one hand, it seems really weird that this huge cyber attack would happen right when they were talking about doing a 10 day lockdown.  It also just seems to be one of those crazy theories that the Q community are into.  They love gloom and doom stuff.  And on another hand, I have a one year old son and it would be awful if this did happen and I wasn't prepared.  I just don't even know anymore.

They're not a very political person at all, and tells me repeatedly that they don't like talking about it. I do open political discussions with them somewhat often, because I find it important to know where they stand on things and for them to know where I'm standing too. I've tried poking factual holes in their reasoning for a few years, but maybe I'm too rough with it. My dad can get through to them though, to plant those seeds of doubt.

My fear is that their parents are Q people. They are stuck at home with them due to CoVid. They don't really watch the news either, so their main source of info is probably the parents. We weren't old enough to vote in 2016, so they probably just went with whatever their parents did.

It hurts to watch such a beautiful, gentle soul support such a narcissistic spoiled brat.

However, I'm not going to stop being their friend. Part of the problem here in America is not having civil discussions with people whose views are completely opposite of yours. I'm not going to add to that problem by ending a friendship that's lasted for so long. We still can have great conversations and enjoy our time together. It shouldn't be a us vs them mentality.

40038,40038,QAnonCasualties,pip4bn,1,45,braith_rose,Honest question- are there any Qanoners that lean left politically?,"I have a family member who has recently started reiterating Q ideas and its clear to me whats starting to happen. I've been lurking on the web, and recently found the 60 minute special. A lot of it resonated. I'm asking this not to be divisive, but because this family member has always leaned conservative. In addition, I've noticed I have not seen many examples of left leaning Qanoners, IRL or otherwise. I also watched a VICE doc on Q not too long ago, and it really shed some light on the origins of Qanon (on 4chan, trumpism, antisemitism &amp; far right involvement). 

I'd be interested to see if there are people on the other side that fall victim to this. One thing that peeved me enough to write this post is the way that the 60 minute interviewer and host spoke about the issue, largely painting it as purely mental health issue and online radicalization (which I understand and agree still that it is a huge part). I understand they are probably not interested in politicizing this issue because they might want to pander to the part of their base that is ""moderate \*(cough cough conservative)\*"" but I feel like this does a large disservice to those of us who want to understand the issue further. Sure, there may be people in other countries that could be Q, but I wonder where we would be now if american right leaning political figures such as MTG, trump, and far right speakers had not legitimized this in the previous administration and past few years.

There is so much overlap in antivaxx, trumpism, and qanon communities. I feel that this uncovers a larger personality trope and speaks to which types are more likely to fall victim. Interviewers avoiding this are not saving the skins of right leaning sympathizers. What does this say about your people that they are almost exclusively falling for this? Can you find any examples of left leaning qanoners? And if not, do you feel that the media does not want to paint this as a strictly conservative issue?

Empathetic and kind but was always an apolitical person. I convinced her to vote Democrat pretty easily for the 2018/2020 elections just on the basis of Republicans never prioritizing the environment and constant reminders of the shit Trump's pulled.

But she's always been *kind* of an anti-vaxxer (doesn't believe in the whole autism thing but didn't let us get flu shots while we were minors) and said herself she doesn't really know how to tell ""the right information from the wrong"". And ever since the pandemic's started, she's been video chatting with her old high school friends who are staunch Republicans. I looked through some of their texts while helping her optimize her phone and it was filled with Democrats being called ""the Socialists"" and complaints about BLM. She said she generally tries to keep her friends from going on about politics too much but it seems like she's ""outnumbered"" as the only apolitical/Democrat-leaning one out of the 5 who discuss conspiracy theories and how they're related to God as casual chitchat.

Last year she almost fell for the Pandemic video that made rounds and went off the rails trying to convince me that hydroxychloroquine was the miracle cure to COVID. She tried to claim that all of this wasn't tied to the Republicans. I got so worked up finding counter evidence and she slowly dropped it only to bring it back up today (yes, at *this* point of the fucking pandemic). And surprise surprise, she had a group call with her friends earlier today. She also started bringing up the Democrats being involved in pedo rings (pizzagate??) and I realized that this stuff is quickly veering into Qanon territory, isn't it?

I really feel like I've reached this point where if I don't do something now, she'll eventually fall into the Qanon hole too, especially when I move out and I'm not there to constantly refute her points and recruit my very passive (but highly intellectual/logical and immune to bullshit like this) dad to help me.

Should I tell her to stop talking to her friends? I can tell her to stop watching the weird right-wing religious sermons and conspiracy videos her friends send her but I just know that she'll eventually restart watching them (thinking they're ""harmless"") once I move out. It's already exhausting having to constantly pull my mom away from the party that wants to deny me basic hunan rights as a (closeted) lesbian woman and being the only one in my family who's actually concerned about these conspiracies potentially consuming her life.

39767,39767,QAnonCasualties,pe8lgs,1,34,Interesting_Bug9348,How do I move forward with family rejection,"I am new to reddit but know someone might understand where i am coming from.  I grew up in a Christian family, wekt to a Christian school,  youth group, lead worship you name it. Grew up in a family with 5 other siblings having now 19 nieces and nephews, no children of our own right now. 

For the last 3 yrs i have noticed a trend with my 3 brothers politically.  The first election with Trump i did vote for him because of being persuaded by my brothers. He was not against abortion etc etc. So ya i did it, cast my vote for him first term. Well here comes 2020, election. After doing tons of research, i personally did not feel he should have my vote. So...Biden there we go vote is in...done move forward. 

Since my re thinking of changing parties, i have noticed the closest brother i had was becoming very distant, negative wirh me as well as in my opinion brain washing his kids.

Ganna cut to the chase, i lost all my 5 sibilings to the politial, mask, vaccine issue. I am vaccinated, and mask up out of respect for those who have lost loved ones. I have been in thr hospital numerous times, being told that its stress and anxiety. I have now found out that my brothers r telling there kids that i am demonically controlled,  that it is my fault the fall of Afghanistan happened because of my vote and the list goes on. My brother called my parents crying saying to leave the state as the chinese were attacking from Canada and going to take of America. Saying all this,  they heard his kids crying in the background saying ""daddy are we going to be ok?!"". Keep in mind this is 8,10,12 and 13 yr olds hearing his father say this.

This has put me not just into mental depression but has taken a toll on my body. My husband as been so supportive but there is onlynso much he can do. My family believes that i changed ever since i met him. Honestly? If anything itw for the good.  He has taught me how to truly love people OUTSIDE the church walls.

1) People spread QAnon because they love the extreme reaction it elicits. It's a power trip.

2) Just like other cults it elicits a sense of purpose and belonging. That's why it's most popular by those who feel lonely and useless - like the elderly and the jobless. 

3) It contains enough truths to attract newcomers (they go into the insane parts later)

4) It intrigues the followers with endless intricate puzzles and ever-coming ""next levels"" of the conspiracy.

5) The followers can easily feel morally superior.

25978,25978,QAnonCasualties,f13on4,1,7,sleepyjess,I don't know how worried to be,"So for the past, maybe four or five years, but definitely in the last three, my mom has been kind of getting into conspiracy theories. It sort of started like 8 or so years ago when she started to get into Buddhism and meditation (which I don't want to conflate with QAnon! I have no prob with Buddhism, I thought it was cool that she was learning about it) which led her getting into more spiritual stuff like past life stuff, energy healing, stuff like that. All of that I don't have a problem with at all. 

But somehow, at some point, it pivoted into conspiracies where she's like talking about great spiritual awakenings and stuff. She started having me watch all these videos from the Gaia network, like about aliens, and told me she thinks the residents of Paradise were all benevolent aliens, like outer space aliens, and the government wanted to attack them which is why Paradise burned down. Like what???

She's never super pushy, my mom is a really gentle person and we're close. She says ""I know this stuff sounds crazy, but hear me out"" and has that attitude. My dad won't hear any of it anymore, he is staunchly against it and so she's pretty much stopped telling him about her conspiracy stuff. My older sister is the same. Mom mostly just talks to me and my younger brother, and I'm kind of trying to get her to not keep sending stuff to him because he's only 20 and in college - he's young and has his own shit to worry about and I think it freaks him out. I just want him to concentrate on school and his job and not have to manage his mom getting into weird stuff. I'm 28, for context, and my older sis is 34. My mom always says that she values that she is able to share stuff with me.

Most of the stuff she tells me about leads her back to the conclusion that the world is on the cusp of a spiritual collective awakening and that is it all about love and that we will all sort of ""awaken"" and have a higher moral consciousness, and to do this, we need to send love to one another. That part is fine with me, sounds nice even. Like I said, she's a very warm, loving, and gentle person, and this hasn't changed. However, she's also gotten into the deep state and the cabal and all that, and that's led her to QAnon, which is what puts me on edge. 

She's anti-trump and heavily liberal, which is why this is so weird to me. She doesn't seem to be fully into QAnon, but just sends me videos from time to time and asks my opinion. I'm not sure if I should be doing something about it. I tell her my honest opinion (though I do this gently) and she doesn't get mad, but it doesn't deter her from watching more stuff. I've told her not to send money to people or go anywhere to meet groups of these people and she agreed. I've said entertaining different viewpoints is good, but I don't want her to become one of those people who only consumes this kind of conspiracy media and nothing else. I've reminded her to think critically and do her research and make sure all the sources are valid (who would have thought I would have to remind her? Historically it's been the other way around lol) and she agrees, but then still sends me this stuff.

 I don't want it to end up changing her down the road. I also don't want her to stop talking to me about it, because then I think she might feel cut off from the whole family and that could feed into how much she consumes of this kind of stuff. I guess I don't really know what to do about it. Thought I would vent. I love my mom so much and she's super duper smart (she has a doctorate and she's super respected in her field, super hardworking), has experienced a lot in her life, and incredibly loving and kind. It just is so weird that she would end up getting into this kind of stuff, but I want to support her as best I can without supporting the conspiracy theories themselves.

My mom is Chinese and consumes mostly media in Chinese.

Today I had a conversation where she brought up Q stuff, saying Trump was hiding in a base somewhere under the sea biding his time before becoming president again. Also apparently he saved some brainwashed kids from being transformed into weapons by the CIA. This might sound funny but hearing this out of my mom's mouth in a serious manner just made me scared and sad.

That makes it very hard for me to find resources online that I can show her and hopefully help her see reason a little. That's why I'm here. I know its a long shot, seeing the great majority of this community is probably American, but I had to try. I'm looking for articles in Chinese from reputable sources that I can maybe convince her to read, debunking the Q bullshit.

I'm furious.","I'm still having a hell of a time wrapping my head around this.  My whole family believes this shit.  I saw it starting to form four years ago, but I was so swept up in the moment I could only see the way my family was putting me and the children of our family in harm's way for their stubborn desires.  I've been called a Sheeple last year for trying to establish boundaries so many times by so many different people who claim to love me, I'm only now finally putting the pieces of it all together.  They've all collectively put me in so much danger in 2020 alone, just by not believing in Coronavirus, that it has me honestly feeling like a complete orphan.  

Four years ago, my state was on fire.  Every single mountain in our direct region with the exception of one we camped on was burning that summer.  These assholes had planned a camping trip/family reunion, so that's what we were forced to do.  I hadn't had my self esteem built up yet, I was so caught up in the dysfunctional family dynamic that I was just starting to set boundaries for myself and was experiencing the beginnings of the inevitable health problems that come with suppressing your true feelings for 30 years.  I made an attempt to set a boundary, first of all, I knew that our state's air quality was so horrific that we were all struggling, young and old.  On top of this, I have a reproductive system condition known as PMDD, which is like PMS on steroids.  I get a lot of pain, bleeding, fatigue and mood swings in the days/weeks leading up to my period essentially.  The last fucking thing I want to do as a privileged yet wounded-ass animal, is have to sleep/shit/bleed out in the woods. So I made it clear that I was willing to camp ONE NIGHT with them.  My Qmother made sure to shatter that boundary and forced me to tow their boat, which was the camp's source of fun.  So now if I do stick firm to my boundaries, I'm ruining fishing and swimming for a dozen children along with a half dozen jerk ""adults"".  I'm so angry that I don't even care anymore if anyone in my family comes across this and realizes it's me.  Your little family ""Sheep's"" bout to Baaaaaa as loud as she can from the highest mountain top, you abusive wolves!

Instantly, this trip was triggering flashbacks of my childhood, from the way my mother instantly and accusatorily told me that I was not allowed to drink and to ""be on my best behavior"" at this camping trip.  In my 30's.  Not allowed to drink while camping.  Every other sibling and even Q stepdad, drunk the whole three days.  I finally broke on the final night and drank three beers.  My other sister in law shows up wasted and is openly badmouthing and threating to beat up my sister.  I mutter one comment to my stepdad about it under my breath, ""looks like it's your girls against ma's I guess.""  and shattered whatever ""perfection"" image he was using to ignore what was happening for hours at this point in front of all of us, I was just lucky enough to have been the direct and only witness of their threats against my sister.  So a few weeks later, my mother is spinning this story that I was ""so wasted that I must have blacked out and that the night before I had been screaming ""fuck you!"" at everyone.""  My period takes me places that are bad, but not that far.  That never happened, and both of my siblings have attested to that, but my mother twisted the story to every outside family member and friend whose ever known me that wasn't there to see that I did not behave that way.  She blamed the entire incident on me, took my stepsister's side who she's known for a decade at most, and then proceeded to scream in my face the next morning when I told her she promised to get me out of the woods on the third day, first thing in the morning.  Well it was the third day, why are they using the boat again?  She screamed at me, then started packing up the whole camp very dramatically so that everything was painted to be my fault.  In this three days, I witnessed my niece get stung by something near her eye, nobody did anything about it but me.  There was a bear and a moose near our camp, stepsister in law is allowing her 3 year old to roam, I and my sister are chasing after her.  I've met this woman once prior to this incident when we went swimming, she was openly talking shit about my body while my stepdad and mother were within in ear shot.  This woman was only related to us by marriage, but they took her side.  She also talked about how she believed that we as a society should have just allowed her 21 year old OD victim patient (she was a nurse, IDK if she still is, God I hope not) to die because she's a dumbass for OD'ing in the first place.  I had to sit there and quietly stomach this shit for days.  My other stepsister, she's trying to get her new boyfriend to fuck her in the tent and HE had the morals enough to not do that feet away from her eight and twelve year old children.  That same boyfriend kicked his dog across the campsite.  My truck window wouldn't roll up and it rained inside of my vehicle for three straight nights.  I was expected to watch it happen and not complain- don't ruin our wonderful camping trip with your negative emotions, now! I was fucking trapped there with my child thanks to my mother and thanks to this stupid fucking boat.  I'd spent a half hour feeding and slathering my sister's kids in sunscreen, they rushed them out onto the boat.  As they were driving away I tossed the sunscreen to her and told her to get my kid, they come back hours later and her albino babies are in pristine condition- mine's nose is fucking bubbled from a 2nd degree sunburn.  I asked WTF SIS?  She said, she ""tried to, but he said he didn't want any.""  She let a kid tell her no when it was a need, not a want.  So after all of this, even if I HAD been screaming, ""fuck you!"" to every single adult at that campground that night, which I did not do, it would have absolutely been justified based off of all of the bullshit I was having to witness and endure that trip.  This made me start to back away from them completely, to start to protect the mental health of my child and I.  This exact same shit happened to me when I was a teenager when they'd force me to go camping, and my dumbass let all of those years in between having to live with them and my own personal freedom away from it all, brainwash me back into believing we are a happy family and we can get along with each other, and most importantly, that we have each other's best interests at heart.  

Trigger warning- sexual abuse.

This happened to me the year after I developed PTSD from being raped by a neighbor.  A neighbor, mind you- my Qmother had never even met.  But she took his side.  She told me it was my fault that it happened, I shouldn't have been drinking around him.  This is the same line she used when I was 18, and my best friend since 4th grade tried to take advantage of me at a party.  My fault for drinking.  When I went to her when I was about a month shy of turning 18, and confided in her that the 23 year old army guy date tried to stick his hands down my pants in the movie theater on the first date, she encouraged me to give him a break, dudes are just ragingly horny like that.  My naive ass trusted him more.  He eventually sodomized me in the back of a car.  I never told anyone until my first relationship, that guy kept pushing buttsex on me and I finally broke down and told him why I could never even fathom trying it.  I was molested at five years old by a cousin of the same sex, and went to my Qmother sobbing the words, ""I had sex.""  She and my aunt figured out that my uncle had been molesting the cousin that molested me, and they sent her away instead of turning him in.  My mother then went on to pull a Molestation-Adjacent move, in when she and my father announced divorce, he disappeared for a few months.  When he came back, they had make up sex every single night with the door open, with their traumatized puberty-aged child's bedroom across the hall.  When I finally worked up the courage to confront her about it, that I could hear them and it was ruining my sleep, she promised me she wouldn't do it anymore.  That night she again, open doored, broke that promise to me.  When I confronted her about it, she used the ""day I let a kid tell me how to live my life..."" speech.  

My point about all of this is that they don't give a fuck about protecting kids.  They won't even fucking put sunscreen on a child.  They do nothing to even protect their own, let alone ""trying to save the other children of the world.""  Fuck them all.  BAAAAAAA!

They've shown me their true nature, and I'm going to do everything in my power to disappear from them and to protect my kiddo from their shitty ass mentalities.  Thank God I've been pulling away for the past decade.  Here I was guilting myself for that all of this time.  I cannot believe I have grinded my teeth away, and wrecked my health, trying to fucking maintain some sort of a relationship with these lunatics.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0kp5x/youre_serious_when_you_tell_me_that_this_is_all/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l0kp5x/youre_serious_when_you_tell_me_that_this_is_all/,1.0,2021-01-19 14:19:21

Even before covid things were pretty crazy (in the world &amp; his perception of it all)...  trump saviour, flatearth, climate hoax, declass docs, blah blah.

Pre-covid I noticed friends were slowly distancing themselves from myQultist or would ignore his texts when he would send them link after link. During the pandemic he was constantly rage posting or internet arguing so a lot of friends deleted him, screenshot him to mock him or would reach out to me asking wtf is going on.

As restrictions are significantly lifting where we live, I saw a recent picture on fb of his ‘best’ friends at a bar.   My Q did not get an invite (he’s been friends with most of these guys for 20years and WOULD have been there).  A few weeks ago my Qultists tried getting in touch with 2 guys and he was ignored or blown off.  When he talks to people (on the phone/in person), I can tell they’re trying to steer the conversation in a different direction.

He’s part of a huge music scene and a lot of people have commented they are happy people are “weeding themselves out” by exposing their racist, msyogonist, xenophobic attitudes. They aren’t wrong.

I can’t imagine a lot of ”friends” going back to rubbing shoulders with him once large gatherings are back. He has 3 Qfriends and the rest of his Qfriends are from gab, Twitter, etc.

Do you think it’ll be the same for your Q, or do they have enough likeminded (real life) friends that it won’t make a difference? 

This gives my Qultist another reason to alienate himself from the rest of the world.

So my family has just been ridiculous obviously that's why I'm here. They have spent a year fighting me about following guidelines instead of using any of that time to spend with their first grand kid. She's 16 months, I have a cancer history obviously better safe than sorry. They have lied and tried to endangered us multiple times because they wanted to go eat in a restaurant; or see a large group of friends instead of whatever we had planned.  Whatever. I really don't care what they do, just don't put us in harm's way. Ya know?

So my curiosity is this, do any of you out there have any other cults or cult like things in their families history? My dad is also a proud non practicing scientologist and forced us all in when we were young.

I’ve been watching the DC riot stuff pretty closely and I noticed that my mom posted about it on Facebook and how shameful it is. She’s a lifelong republican, a trump “supporter” (she regularly criticizes his leadership skill but thinks he’s a business genius), and very conservative.

My aunt and some other lady came into her statuses to start spreading Q. It started with “Those weren’t trump supporters, it was Antifa” and several days later, my mom is fully convinced that Biden cheated and stole the election, that conservatives never riot and “take things in stride”, the left is evil and the source of the DC riot, and that you can’t love America without being a trump supporter. She also started publicly posting transphobic content, which hurts me personally since I’m dating a transgender woman. 

I really thought my mom was smarter than this. When my dad got into Q he would send all those videos he found but she never watched them.

39909,39909,QAnonCasualties,pgll09,1,27,graedus29,Just despairing today,"I called my brother last night. We've had a no politics rule for about a year and a half and we've been able to have conversations on other topics. Same old stuff every time, how are the kids, how's the family.

My brother was OG QAnon. None of the real crazy stuff like sex trafficking or adrenochrome or JFK Jr., but he does believe Trump won 49 states in 2020 and all that kind of stuff. I knew how he felt about the vaccine because he had spammed his family with every fringe article about a supposed vaccine reaction (his wife and kids all got vaxxed). 

When I called him last night, he said he was annoyed because they were quarantining. A friend of his was exposed and tested negative, hung out with my brother the next day, then tested positive the day after that. I figured this was my one shot to ask about the vaccine so I wouldn't have to spend the rest of my life asking myself if I could have done more. I asked as gently as I could. His answers were polite but extremely terse. I gave him a brief appeal and he thanked me and asked if we could put that topic on the list of things we don't discuss. I was glad I tried, but it was clear that hell would freeze over before it was ever something he ever considered.

He could begin expressing symptoms in a couple of days. And COVID may be 99% survivable but it sure as hell isn't for people with his medical profile. If he dodges this bullet, there will be so many others. I appreciate that he keeps the Q stuff out of our relationship, but hearing about the choices and decisions he is making is still so difficult.

My brother is much older than me and was a second father figure to me for much of my life, and I love him very much. He's always been so intelligent, but over the last several years his mind has been completely captured by falsehoods. I know there's nothing I can do to help him. I want to continue being a source of sanity in his life but the emotional cost of interaction is just so high.

Well this is a short story about my boss. This guy runs a package store and has worked in them for his whole life. This guy has a LOT of free time when he’s working, so of course he fills it with searching Facebook conspiracy garbage. 

The first day I met him, one of the first things he said was “now I can tell you what’s really going on with the coronavirus!!” And the classic “I’m not a conspiracy theorist I’m just really well read”. Fast forward a week, and he is showing me videos of “doctors” explaining how it’s a hoax and telling me what’s really in vaccines. 

Well, this whole time I have been playing along with it, but have been trying to “one up” him on his nonsense. He says “the corona is like a flu” I’ll say “hah you believe in the flu?” He’ll bring up George Soros, and I’ll tell him “psh, that guy is being controlled by aliens!”

I do feel bad, like maybe I am making things worse, but there is no other way I can get through a day at work. There is 0% chance that he will change, so seeing him scurry off to investigate things that I just made up is the only joy I have at the workplace anymore. 

The only time I really cringe is when he gets into it with the customers. These people are paying for your expenses, they are supporting your business, and you choose to argue with them and spout conspiracy nonsense? What kind of grown human does that. Recognize the bigger picture. No matter what you believe, if you want to sell the most stuff possible, you should probably keep your opinion to yourself.

35623,35623,QAnonCasualties,n0bcp4,1,339,thisacctisclassified,I just got disowned for getting the vaccine. (21M),"So I just got out of a conversation with my qparents where they essentially disowned me for getting the vaccine. Admittedly its not quite that simple, our relationship was already at its absolute breaking point before then, the vaccine was just what pushed it over the top, but 90% of the problems were and are QAnon related. 

Before covid my parents were staunch conservatives who I certainly didn't agree with most of the time, but could have a respectful debate with. After discovering QAnon sometime over the past year though my mom has become absolutely detached from reality and any attempt at reason turns into a shouting match. My dad never fully went down the QAnon rabbit hole but he still religiously supports my mom and everything she does. This has lead to a complete breaking down of trust to the point that I actively avoid interacting with them as much as possible since even the most mundane topics can turn into full-blown shouting matches which make me feel terrible about myself. 

They've tried to force me to change universities because they said I was being indoctrinated at my current school. They completely harassed and disrespected my former girlfriend to the point that she was forced to leave me because she just couldn't deal with it anymore. In December they forced me to attend a 30+ person Christmas party and risk getting Covid or else they said I wouldn't be allowed to live in the house and would be homeless.

Sometime in December my mom sent me threatening texts telling me I am not to get any medical procedure (covid test, vaccine, etc.), without her approval first. I told her that that was completely ridiculous and what I do with my body is none of her business and tried to set up some boundaries. When I got home she completely screamed at me bc she refused to accept my boundaries and broke me down until I caved and said I'd discuss getting the vaccine with her first.

End of March I got the vaccine without telling anybody. I didn't even really have time to anyway since my eligibility opened up unexpectedly anyway. Today I got a text from my dad saying they want to pull me out of school since its requiring vaccines next semester. I said it wasn't gonna be a problem bc I already got the vaccine anyway. 

My dad proceeded to go completely ape shit and referenced my ""agreement"" with my mom I made over winter break. I said that I was always clear with her that it was none of her buisiness and I only agreed to anything bc I was coerced and she was screaming at me and I wanted it to stop. Besides she also had re-neged on several ""agreements"" with me made under similar circumstances. I also said that I knew an argument would've happened if I called her anyway and I didn't want to deal with that, which he didn't even deny. He said it was completely disrespectful and that I should've just dealt with being screamed at earlier since I made a deal. I said the problem obviously isn't that I didn't speak with her, its the fact that I got the vaccine. He then proceeded to tell me that I will be completely cut off from the family financially from now on and am on my own. No housing, food, or even health insurance.

I'm not really upset or surprised, in fact I'd kinda been expecting some shit like this and already have been preparing. I'm just kinda numb right now. I have my own place for the summer and have slowly been migrating my financial stuff out of my shared account with my parents and onto my own, though I'm obviously gonna speed that up now in case my parents try and withdraw anything. Since I'm living in the college town this summer I'll have free bus access and the ability to get a job, so I won't need my car which my parents said they are repossessing (I never paid for it and they cover insurance, so its really their car which they let me use). And even the health insurance which I wasn't expecting I'm pretty sure I can get fairly cheap through the university as long as I'm enrolled. I'm mostly just worried about paying for the rest of school. I have enough money saved to pay for the next semester myself and I'm already expecting to be an RA next year so my room and board will be covered, but I still need like 5-6k more to pay for winter semester tuition. I'll be a senior next year so I'm so close to graduating, in fact I'll be done with all my major requirements after next semester, I'll just be a few classes short of the total credit hours required to officially graduate. Bcuz of my dad's income and how FAFSA works I'm not gonna be eligible for loans for like 3 more years so if I can't come up with the money I'm gonna have to drop out and take time off to cover it. I have like 2-3k in contributions to a retirement fund which I think I can withdraw if I need but I'm hoping to avoid that.

I'm just really scared and don't really know what the future looks like. I never really wanted to cut off contact with my family, I just wanted the constant gaslighting and screaming to stop. In the past I've wormed my way back in by apologizing profusely and begging for forgiveness, but I'm not doing that this time, mostly because I have more self-respect than that but also because I'm more self-sufficient than I was in the past and I'm not as scared by their threats anymore. I have a few close friends who have promised to support me in any way I can, but I doubt that would extent to financial support and I don't really want to be a bother to them, so I'm mostly on my own. My family and I have always had somewhat of a rocky relationship compared to my siblings but I never thought it would worsen to this extent. I wouldn't even really give a shit if they bought into all the QAnon shit if they didn't use it to try and turn my life upside-down at every opportunity.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/n0bcp4/i_just_got_disowned_for_getting_the_vaccine_21m/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/n0bcp4/i_just_got_disowned_for_getting_the_vaccine_21m/,1.0,2021-04-28 09:56:27

32818,32818,QAnonCasualties,l9yklz,11,6,Perfect-Secret-711,I miss my Mom and I'd like some advice re: mental health and therapy,"This is my first post here and when I was referred to this group. I was skeptical at first if I truly belonged because while Mom really fell into believing conspiracies through reading retired military texts, watching Dan Bongino, reading more and more extreme-right leaning sites, getting rid of cable, and instead as a retired, single person, consuming hours of Youtube. She claims she doesn't know what Q is but has obviously wandered down several rabbit holes which has led to mental and emotional deterioration noticed not only by me but friends and other family members, even the conservative ones who have always been conservative but they see her struggling and are concerned.

I joined this group shortly after it got really bad, but the day of the House impeachment hearing, she kept texting me all kinds of things that made it seem as though the world was going to grind to a startling halt at any moment. It wasn't the typical pedophelia/Pizza Gate or blood ritual things that one often thinks of as traditionally ""Q"" but more about the Pope being arrested, mass blackouts &amp; internet troubles happening world wide, our news not telling us what is really happening, our ballots being sent overseas to be counted after the election,etc. I have told her in the past, and continue to do so, that I can't talk about political things with her because I can't live in that constant space of fear nor can I tolerate my algorithms being changed by the links she sends me. The other reason I give is that I have had a lot of financial identity concerns lately with everything being so digitial and really want to try to stick to only my trusted sites. That strategy worked for a while but she was paranoid and so frightened that day, and I was in a work setting without the time or mental space to help her out of her lonely, angry space. It was so mentally and emotially wrenching and took me a few weeks to recover from even with a support network of amazing family and friends around me.

Come to find out, she decided to wean herself off of some of her meds without consulting her doctor and has constantly insisted she is ""fine"" but has struggled with clinical depression, anxiety, trauma, and legal substance abuse on and off throughout her entire life. Reading the books recommended by this group (particulary Steven Hassan/studying on what happens when the brain's amygdala is triggered) has helped me heal and process some of the defensive things she has been saying quite a bit and taking some time off has helped as well. Today we spoke and she seemed much better now that she is taking her meds again. She still is fearful of what is ""going down"" in our government but no where near what she was battling a couple weeks ago. I don't know if that's because of a combination of the meds working and some of the conspiracy forums and sites being taken down but I feel such relief at having some piece of her back at least for now. The advice here to continue a conversation and let her know she is loved has been vital but it has been so tricky. As an only child, single-parent, 30 something person, I don't want to lose her.

Maybe this has been discussed before and I hope not to annoy anyone by re-asking but have any of you experienced a past pattern of mental illness in your Q person before they fell into this that has re-ignighted some of their past trauma/triggers? Has anyone helped anyone out of that or could anyone recommend some good books? Also, I have seen resources for getting counselling but is there a specific specialty I should look up in a counsellor when seeking some help with this? Mom doesn't believe in therapy but I do. I generally have done better with self-help with my own mental/emotional issues but think this is a bit beyond me to pull out of myself.

Finally, I want to say that I really appreciate all this forum has brought forth and given to so many who, like me, are really struggling with watching their loved ones go through something like this. Sending out positivity, healing, and strength for all of you who have come here seeking some comfort and support.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l9yklz/i_miss_my_mom_and_id_like_some_advice_re_mental/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l9yklz/i_miss_my_mom_and_id_like_some_advice_re_mental/,0.81,2021-02-01 08:34:09

My family (especially my mom) have been on the conspiracy bus since last March or so, but I only found out this last week that it is definitely QAnon. They're officially off all mainstream social media and started using BitChute recently so I know it's too late. I just don't know what to do. I'm in college and away from home right now, but she keeps sending me videos. It absolutely wrecks my mental health, I'm expected to watch them and talk about it to her, and she is the kind of person who would completely snap if I fought with her about it so I've been trying to grey rock it as much as possible. Do you have any tips for responding to these videos? I need to just deal with it until I graduate college, I'm working on becoming financially independent and able to distance myself but that is not a possibility right now. A few days ago it was some guy on YouTube talking about how the vaccine is bad and that everyone should buy gold/crypto before the market shuts down, and she just sent me another thing, this time on BitChute, who apparently knows that all covid tests are a scam and fake. I know she's trying to ""recruit"" me.

I just found this sub and you have no idea how relieving it is to read that I'm not alone in struggling with Q family members. My (17f) Q-adjacent mom is suuuuper antivax and totally opposed to me getting the covid shot; she'll start crying if I mention it because she thinks it'll make me infertile and chronically ill and she threatens to not let me go to college in the fall if she thinks I'll get the shot once I'm there. She's even filed a religious exemption for me at my university (I'm not religious but she is Catholic) so that I won't have to get it. I feel guilty for lying for the exemption and possibly putting my roommates and classmates at risk but I don't want them to know about my Qmom or think that I am antivax myself. I plan to get vaccinated once I get to college, but I won't turn 18 until a month later and the state I'm in requires parental permission for minors, and I absolutely do not want her to find out (our relationship is strained enough as it is). My university will be holding a vaccination clinic not long after I arrive, but I'm scared they won't let me get vaccinated because I'm still 17 or that it will show up on my/my parents insurance because the school has it on file. If I were to get it at a nearby CVS-type store, would they check for ID if I lied about my age? Or if I told them my real age, would they check for parental consent (16+ can go get vaccinated without the parent present, but they still need permission)? I also plan to get caught up on my other vaccinations, but I have no idea how to do this because we don't have a doctor we regularly visit, I'm not financially independent enough to pay for them myself, and I'm scared they would show up on insurance bills.

Started thinking about this due to the similarities to rapture predictions, which have probably been happening pretty consistently since right after Jesus (maybe not ""rapture"" predictions per se, but predictions of his return). Yes, QAnon is more primarily a political conspiracy movement than religious, and so a better model is probably other reactionary political movements. Jesus was also likely very political, but was more concerned with religion. So, I don't know if there's any history of a political-movement-turned-religion.

35339,35339,QAnonCasualties,mum8is,1,6,LividHuckleberry5956,This is the ULTIMATE SUPPORT for anyone wanting to heal from the Q HOAX,"This may not go over well with you if you got a case of the feels and you're not willing to take responsibility for what is going on.  If you feel wronged by someone because they chose to believe the Q lies and now your relationship(s) is in tatters, then perhaps you need to look in a mirror.  When the world gets tough, you have to get tougher in order to hold things together.  I know this media phenomenon has not been easy on any of you, but once you realize that one of the purposes behind all of these lies was to destroy families and relationships you will begin to see your role in it.  You must avoid the right/left paradigm.  You must rise above the division and hatred and make your stand on the rock of logic, truth and unconditional love!

Modern media mind control/brainwashing is as sophisticated as it has ever been.  It isn't anyone's fault for believing a lot of this garbage, as it is designed to target certain people who will be more vulnerable to believing the lies.  For those of us who can see through the deception, it is up to us to provide a place for our loved ones/friends to come back to.  Let me explain.

Okay, I know we're all here to vent and get all feely...but this type of sentiment is playing into all of it: You're either against it or for it, but that's based on the premise of it being real in the first place....which none of it is!   It's all lies that folks are being brainwashed to believe, but for or against it is not the answer. Barricading, not being there or just shutting people out....not the answer! We're dealing with a system that wants to destroy your ability to love, and by feeling this way or working through your feelings like this...being for or against it...you are letting that system win. It is not a lose/lose situation when you choose to love someone for who they are as opposed to what lies they believe. They are literally standing on shores of shifting sand and so are you if you give up on them....but if you simply love them and show them you stand on a rock in the calm centre of the storm....trust me, if they know you love them regardless of what lies they believe and you are mature enough to rise above the division, they will break out of the brainwashing. They will want to join you in the calm centre of the storm because it is the absolute best place to be, right??!  Trust me, I have seen it work first hand; I never gave up on my mom and eventually we both quietly realized it was all a trick! We stopped talking about it, she stopped sending links, no more Fox news when I come over to visit her, she walked back from the brink....it worked!! Because she knew I loved her not the lies she chose to believe. I showed her what was real!  And then Trump lost and that should have snapped people out of the delusion but many doubled down.  So the time is now to stand up and take these relationships back, but you have to work at it.  You have to lead by example.  Show them your love!  Show them where truth and meaning live.  Is it worth losing these relationships because of lies pushed on us by a bunch of soulless corporations intent on turning us against each other and creating more mental illness for the pharma companies to profit from?!?!?  Answer that question out loud to yourself right now!

So instead of just venting here and giving up on your loved ones, especially your Mother who passed you through her in order so you could be alive, maybe let's come up with solutions, guys and gals?! The situation only seems impossible when you think it is. There is a solution. The solution is UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.  Give them a place to come back to!  It's not guaranteed to work with everyone, but you must try this approach!  Please consider this, it will change your life and the life of your family and who knows maybe we can save the country while we're at it instead of just typing our woes in a reddit thread and leaving our family members hanging based on media lies.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/mum8is/this_is_the_ultimate_support_for_anyone_wanting/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/mum8is/this_is_the_ultimate_support_for_anyone_wanting/,1.0,2021-04-20 09:01:30

26208,26208,QAnonCasualties,gv762e,1,15,AlexisKMay,Future Mother-in-law has dragged the whole family into this crap,"Back in late Feb/early March my fiance's mother got sucked into Q and shared it with the whole family. Unfortunately the whole family just went straight into the Q rabbit-hole with her. I was the odd man out after watching all of the videos she sent and articles and doomsday family meetings. I just couldn't believe these claims and the fact that the whole family just accepted it. I felt like I was losing my sanity.

My fiance was really into it for a while and I was scared that I'd never be able to have a conversation with him or watch a movie without some Q interference. He was starting to spead the message and ""red pill"" everyone he could. I had to tell him we couldn't talk Q anymore because I needed to protect myself mentally. I felt like I'd lost my best friend. Then, Easter came and (of course) nothing happened so he started to come out of it. I know I'm very fortunate with this, as many of you have struggled with your own loved ones defending this until they're blue in the face. He still believes but the Q stuff is taken with some criticism before he will fully believe it. The rest of the family is still all into it and it is always the main source of conversation. 

I usually just ignore them or sit quietly when they start to talk about it. Its something we are all used to. During the 2016 election we found out that I did not believe Donald Trump was God's gift to earth and it caused a lot of tension in the family for a while, so now when they start talking politics (which is inevitable) I sit there quietly and try to block out everything they're saying. It's sickening and I know that I am very privileged to sit quiet in that discomfort instead of talking to them. I am terrified of confrontation, and the few times I tried to stand up for my beliefs it was ugly, the whole family ganged up on me so we just had to agree to disagree and walk away. But, of course they can still loudly voice their opinions 🙄 

With everything happening in the world right now, my heart is so heavy. I've been crying on and off for a few days and when I'm not crying I'm angry or numb to everything. My (future) mother-in-law text all of us last night to see how we are doing. I told her that I'm not doing well and she typed me a novel in response, as is usual for her. And I'm so mad. She's saying that George Floyd's murder was planned, these protests are planned. That everything will be okay once Martial Law is enacted and the deep state and Democrats are finally given their justice, just trust the plan. She's telling me that Trump is going to financially help all of these businesses rebuild after their destruction, and that everything is just peachy. No worries. I didn't read the entire message because I couldn't stomach it. And my fiance is juuuuust deep enough that he thinks she might be right. I can't voice my anger, I'm speechless.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/gv762e/future_motherinlaw_has_dragged_the_whole_family/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/gv762e/future_motherinlaw_has_dragged_the_whole_family/,1.0,2020-06-02 13:17:34
39364,39364,QAnonCasualties,p8er5h,51,86,tmc0,A vent and a plea for advice. Husband sliding into Q-adjacent territory.,"I think I need your support and advice.  I have been with my husband for twenty four years, and married for eleven. I am sorry to say that I think he is now q adjacent.  We argue daily now.  He is anti-mask, anti-covid vax and most upsetting, rejecting news from any official source, in favour of his approved list of covid scaremongering folks. I feel like my chances of pulling back to a shared reality are fading daily.  We have three kids, a great life really, a nice house that we both love and we both work hard in good jobs, and he really is a great dad, giving loads of his time to them. But I feel like it is all falling apart. 

We went through a bad patch in 2016. I did the paperwork to register us both for votes for the UK referendum to leave the EU.  We had lived in the UK within the 15 years previous and so we had a postal vote. I did the paperwork for both of us and assumed, naively, that we would both be voting to remain. I found out only after he cast his vote that he had voted to leave. I honestly felt gutted, betrayed. He knew I felt strongly (pro-EU) about it. He was too lazy to do his own damn paperwork.   Since then, the slide has been to the right, and I feel I have retained my liberal, left of centre stance on most things.  Whereas we used to agree on nearly everything, politically, now it is the opposite.

He has become suspicious of what he sees as diversity 'agendas'. He thinks that gay/trans lifestyles are being promoted.  Didn't want to discuss what homophobia is with our 10 year old (I did this instead).  He has on occasion mentioned Soros and Rothschilds as the driving force behind the things he disapproves of. He admitted the he would have voted for Trump over Clinton in 2016.  But the covid issue has been the most hurtful.  He wears a mask when it is required, but really badly on purpose - so you can see his nostrils - because he thinks you have to 'resist'.  He isn't vaccinated, and thinks those that are, are gullible (me included). I have tried so hard to use reason and logic but ultimately if comes down to the fact that he does not trust official sources and I do. He disagrees with every statistic that comes from an official source, citing quotes from the creator of the PCR test or some random quack professor who has taken that side. They have answers/diversions for everything I say

He has grown a really terrible unkempt beard in the last 9 months, which I see is an attempt to isolate himself, he has almost no contact with  old friends anymore. I was hoping to get some support from his sister to talk to him, but they see each other infrequently, and her attitude was just to leave him think whatever he wants. 

I felt like I could handle this and deal with it personally when it was all private, but recently he has been more vocal - tweeting shit and talking about his views with our friends. I just despair and don't know where to look - like I want to distance myself from his views, but I don't want to obviously fight in front of people. 

I am not prepared to give up on him, or to just pretend it isn't happening, and so the fights are constant, and it is so wearing. I feel so tired and often like I might burst into tears.  I have no idea what to do. I am losing hope that things will improve.  Friends say it will pass, but I am so unhappy. I don't know how to get back to the way things used to be.   Can anyone give my advice on how to stay sane, and keep my marriage?",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/p8er5h/a_vent_and_a_plea_for_advice_husband_sliding_into/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/p8er5h/a_vent_and_a_plea_for_advice_husband_sliding_into/,0.97,2021-08-20 21:48:11

40573,40573,QAnonCasualties,ptbyp9,1,16,okileggs1992,Coworkers who are Q,"So, how do you deal with educated coworkers who think that shots aren't necessary, end up catching Covid.  So far in the past 2 months, people I have worked with for years along with some I just met and worked with since April have caught Covid.  They have exposed others to it including their own family members thinking it's not that big a deal till after the first week (even after several were hospitalized.  Most are highly educated, with Bachelors's and Masters's Degrees but are adamant about getting the shot.

The weirdest thing is one of them asked my opinion about getting the shot, I told this person that I got the shot not only for myself but for those who can't protect themselves yet with the shot (under 11) as this happened prior to the announcement.  I have family members over 60 along with children under 11 as do some of my coworkers who are really pissed about those not getting the shots. While I understand people want the choice to vaccinate that this particular virus was extremely deadly and the delta variant spread as fast as the common cold.  Not everyone takes the precautions I do (pre-existing conditions that make it deadly for me) which is masking up, hand sanitizer and Lysol in my car,  

I asked what they were going to do if her grandbaby died as she is under the age of 5, and would they as grandparents and her parents accept the responsibility that they caused the child's death?  Or would they go around stating it was God's will when they could have kept it from happening?  Things went quiet after that.  People have to be made aware that their actions have consequences whether they like them or not.

Putting people at risk because you don't want to wear a mask or get the vaccine shows that the entitlement and lack of empathy for others is very high.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/ptbyp9/coworkers_who_are_q/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/ptbyp9/coworkers_who_are_q/,1.0,2021-09-22 17:03:45

31621,31621,QAnonCasualties,l1j9u0,7,4,lampfiles,Hope,"Anybody have any hope after today? I do. This has been something that I've been dealing with for about 6 months now. My older sister, in her 30s got really into some Q stuff this year. 

I would describe my immediate family as almost apolitical. Growing up my parents never talked about politics but would vote democrat.  We moved to the suburbs of Atlanta when I was a little kid and went to a private Christian school. We still were never really religious either, maybe went to church every other year on Christmas much to my boredom. Religion never really stuck with me cause I ended up being gay but even before I realized I was gay I just never really cared or bought into it. But to some degree I think my older sister did. She had a kid really young and stayed in the suburbs, while I moved away to Southern California. Even now as an adult I'm still pretty apolitical despite voting for Obama twice, Hillary Clinton, and now Biden. So I have have my opinions and making sure that I can have the same rights as my straight friends and family. 

This past summer she got really into Saving The Children and warned me about pedophiles in Hollywood. She has a young family, and the kids being out of school and quarantine really got to her. I felt bad cause she was having a tough time mentally dealing with all of this. She was was q-adjacent at first just wanting to save children from sex trafficking, despite me telling her that the numbers she was giving me were inflated and she wasn't showing and proof of pizzagate. And unfortunately it just got worse over the fall, she started following more and more instagram accounts that were full fledged Qanon. I thought she'd back off after the election and then after January 6th but she almost doubled and tripled down. Optics wise she was becoming this die hard fan following everyone from Trump Jr. to Candace Owens to all of these meme queens and guys posting from 4chan and 8kun. It was shocking especially since she never talked about Trump or politics before this. I doubt she even knew what 4chan was. 

And at the end of the day I don't mind if she's republican. I might not be a fan of Mitt Romney, John McCain, or Rubio but if she has a different opinion on issues that's okay. I grew up with Christians and Republicans. Most people want the same things out of life. I've lost no friends coming out as gay or anything and my sister was one of the first people I told. So it's all okay to me as long as we all work together and get along. It was just the fangirl and behavior change that I didn't like over one single man. I just don't get idolizing people and in my 30s I've been disappointed by friends, boyfriends, celebrities, teachers, and bosses enough to know everyone should be accountable and nobody is better than anyone else. 

Well long story short, it looks like she unfollowed every single Qanon account on instagram this afternoon after the inaguration. I don't know if she is over it, feels duped, or just needs a break. But if it means getting some sense of my sister back the better. She can vote republican in 2024, but as long as the Qanon, conspiracy, and Trump obsession is done I'll feel a lot better and hope things are starting to change.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l1j9u0/hope/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l1j9u0/hope/,1.0,2021-01-20 21:40:56

Then Trump happened, he fell into the whole MAGA movement, then came the Q memes. Shit derailed quickly and they were on a runaway train. They stopped going places, talking, gardening together. Now they are separating. They have become stuck in a perpetual loop of hurt and pointing fingers.

41793,41793,ReQovery,kf7z10,8,27,cracked_egg_irl,I am a trans woman who voted for Trump in 2016. I voted for Obama in 2012 and Biden in 2020. My story.,"I'm so glad to have found this place! I felt so alone in casting out my Trumpism. I wanted a place to share this journey I had. I never went for QAnon, but I know I would have. I saved and shared a lot of Pizzagate memes on /pol/ so it's almost a guarantee I would have if I hadn't gotten better.

So, in 2008, as much as I wanted to vote for Obama, I was sadly 17 years old during this election. I attended a very conservative, rural high school and I remember we even had a mock election in which McCain had won. 

4 years later, I'm a senior in college. Though I'm still in the South, I've learned a lot. My friends are liberal, facebook is taking off, I've seen enough liberal info on there, voting for Obama again was a no-brainer. I considered myself your average Democrat at the time.

And then, I got a job. Things changed a _lot_ for me. I worked for a pretty cool liberal tech company. And for a while, it was good. It was a chill place and we used Slack to communicate, and it was chill enough that a meme or two was totally cool. There was a girl, we'll call her Zoey. I could hear her giggles from across the room when I posted a meme. Emboldened, I started sending her some memes directly. 

We trade numbers, we hook up, we date. I start finding ""spicy"" memes. They started lightly, stuff you'd find on dark parts of reddit. Slowly but surely, I'm headed to /b/ and the like and finding ""politically incorrect"" stuff. Zoey's a big fan too. They slowly become more tinged with racism, homophobia, antisemitism, misogyny, and all the ilk you can imagine. Slowly through all these jokes, we start to spiral into seeing the ""truth"" in everything.

Then in 2015, Trump announced his candidacy. Of course, like many, we treated it as a fucking joke. And since we made fun of everything, joking about Trump's presidency was following suit. I honestly remember an /r/AskReddit post that got me. It was something like ""People who are seriously supporting Donald Trump, why?"" (and this was when he was a joke candidate) And someone posted some crap about how the others are bad and Trump isn't like them. Well, that got me to thinking, ""well, why the hell not?""

I went to /r/the_donald back when it was in the low 10s of thousands of subscribers in 2015. Back then, it was people just joking about Trump. And memes. Memes I started sharing with Zoey. We sarcastically said how we were totally about Trump to each other. 

But in time, things started changing. Trump started gaining actual political steam. It was far before the primaries, but he was polling well. I was continuing to pile on the shit memes with Zoey and also generally being a pretty bad partner, all things considered. But she loved those memes. And I kept them coming.

Then before the primaries, like laaate 2015, early 2016, I had another friend, we'll call him Aaron. Aaron was on the same type of logic as me. We were both joking sarcastically about how we like Trump. And he proposed the idea of sarcastically going to a Trump rally. The one that's in my city in a couple weeks. I agreed, let's see Trump be dumb.

We were among the first in line. We brought our 3DSes and played pokemon while waiting. I'm not fucking joking lmao. We showed up like 2-3 hours early, seriously. Doors open, we go into a huge room, and we get within the first few rows. It's standing room only and it becomes incredibly tight. 

We wait a while longer and he comes out. And there seriously is something about his campaigning, his speech. He may be a shitbag but he sure does know how to manipulate crowds at a deep psychological level. I remember he first talked about the wall. ""We're gonna build a wall, and who is going to pay?"" he said expectantly. ""MEXICO!"" the crowd shouted. I had no idea about any of this, but when the crowd so around me is attuned and answers his question... it just builds something in you. Shame, perhaps? In any case, going to this rally, while Aaron and I giggled like hell at some of the stupid antics (there was some guitar player who played something so ridiculous we just laughed at how dumb it was). We had our entertainment. But with us, we took an unconscious taint that turned myself from Trump-joking, to full on Trump supporter. We even bought some dumb ripoff merch. I got on Trump's list at some point and donated like $25 so I could get some dumb ""Trump card"" lmao. I bought a MAGA hat and wore it around just to piss people off.

Any time I talked about Trump, I was Schrodinger's douchebag. When the audience took what I said seriously, it was just a joke. When they laughed at the joke, I actually meant it. I saw Trump stickers, I went crazy. Aaron was ready to enable me with a laugh. Zoey caught on with the picture soon enough. She stuck with it.

What I realized had happened was, all my racism was awoken over this long period of time. I grew up in the South. In the US. There was so much covert racism in TV, movies, and media and I didn't realize it. My family was Republican. Even though we were ""color blind"" racists, there is so much unconscious socialization and reinforcement that plants the seeds of racism. Donald Trump watered those seeds in my mind, and emboldened me to go full-on racist. I started using the n-word with Zoey in private. The memes I was sending were directly from /pol/ at this point.

Even though Zoey was a heavily tatooed, dyed hair kind of girl, I know she ended up voting for Trump back then. We travelled to her family. Her mom expressed how great her back deck job was and that her job was done by ""all nice white men"". Yeah, she had the same racist socialization as me. At the time, with my racism truly on my face (but still denying it, of course) I smiled and nodded when she said that. We drank and talked about who we were voting for. It was unanimously for Trump, Zoey included.

The election came and went. Zoey was born in England and we also cheered along Brexit. I felt good. Like we had won something. This went on and on until Zoey and I eventually broke up because I really was a shitty and emotionally abusive partner (would any /pol/ regular make a good partner?)

Well, I eventually turned to drugs to cope with the break up. I was _so_ anti-drug, even pot, that it was wild that I had gotten into them. But I had been drinking and partying, went back to a friend's place after, she smoked some weed, I decided, fuck it, how have I never smoked weed and I'm 25? Well, I got high and felt great. And so the addiction started.

Eventually, I shoot Zoey an email about a year after we broke up. ""I'm high lol. How you been?"" Ya know, the classic, they-forgot-to-block-me-on-email scenario. Well, she's cool with it. We hang out some more. Smoke weed, chill. All the while my mental health has been decaying like shit. My emotional abuse target was back and eventually I make no qualms starting to dump really heavy shit on her. Getting really reliant on her. She has some patience with me and even tries to talk me through things, but I just want sympathy, and that doesn't go well. She gets almost fed up. I go to therapy. The stresses of my life flow out and now I'm really fucking stressed. And I go to her. Bad call. She never wants to talk to me again. Fair enough.

But I stick with the therapy. I want to be better. I'm in a pretty miserable shitpile situation mentally at the time and sessions helped. I stick with it. And I'll never forget this moment. Up until now, this entire story, I've been your plain jane white dude. Well, my therapist mentioned her pregnancy at one point. The word. _Pregnant_. Without a thought, I grabbed my stomach and thought ""I'll never be pregnant"". For a woman who has been practicing for 15 years, I'm sure she's probably seen that miserable, grievous, shriveled-up look once or twice. A woman who had a miscarriage. An infertile woman. But probably never from a _man_. At the time, that wasn't enough for _me_ to realize and accept that I was trans, but she always seemed to hammer me on that. Sometimes she'd throw out the word ""hormones"" (which, yeah I knew what hormone replacement therapy was (switching your T for estrogen makes your body feminine like any cis woman's)). I saw it out of curiosity a _long_ time ago and was fascinated. Jealous, even. I wanted to be a girl when I was little. I always wanted to be a girl.

Over time, the therapy was really working and I thought strange things to myself like ""well, it wouldn't be so weird if I just... one day wore a dress to a session?"" I kept pushing it down though. I did not _want_ to be trans. Just wake up as a girl and nobody is none the wiser one day, that'd be great! Transitioning seemed like hell. Scary. But I knew someone who had done it. She was my roommate in college when she came out. We were still in touch. It wasn't until I hit a _deep_ deep depression and all these thoughts that I wanted to be a girl flooded back to me. Like for 2 weeks I was almost completely out of commission from my depression. I googled ""I don't want to be trans"" like 5 times in a day and finally, someone said something. ""Oh, honey, nobody wants to be trans"". That broke it for me. I thought ""okay, I'm trans... and the best thing for me to do... is transition.""

And that I did. And I learned more about transphobia. How it kept me in the closet. I learned a lot about many forms of bigotry. How they were all the same, and I came to empathize more with those less privileged and come to their aid. How to unlearn my racist past and work to recover from it. That was what sealed me away from Q and all the crap like that forever. Having feelings for other people. Honestly, before therapy, I didn't even really realize other people had feelings. Not even Zoey. I hadn't a shred of empathy in my body. And with all the depression and dysphoria I suffered, it made it easy to spew hate in a way to try to feel better about myself. I believe that better mental health is how we get out of this horribly backwards reality that we are in. And I'm going to become a therapist to do just that.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/kf7z10/i_am_a_trans_woman_who_voted_for_trump_in_2016_i/,/r/ReQovery/comments/kf7z10/i_am_a_trans_woman_who_voted_for_trump_in_2016_i/,0.83,2020-12-17 22:33:58
27926,27926,QAnonCasualties,jb7la5,1,55,csheabob,"Coworker fired for QAnon fueled mania, harassment","A woman (39F) started working at my job a couple months ago or so. Most people got a weird vibe from her from the very beginning, but the weirdos have always been drawn to me, so I ended up getting to know her kind of well. She didn’t have a car and her bf worked out of town for long periods of time so I was giving her rides to and from works a lot of days. 

She started talking about how everyone has parasites and they cause anger issues, mental illnesses, etc. She said she takes dog dewormer and eats a clove of Garlic raw every morning. “Ok, so she’s a conspiracy theorist” I thought, still giving her a chance and not trying to judge her too bad. Then she started showing us videos of Illuminati boy bands or whatever, and started talking about clones and how they drop adrenochrome in their eyes. 

Everyone believed at this point that she was a meth user, due to all of this and her general mannerisms and strange behaviors. She wore flip flops to work one day, which is a health code violation where we work. She got politely asked not to where them again. 

A couple weeks later, she started blowing up the phone of the girl who corrected her about the shoes. Saying her shoes are out of dress code because they’re black (this isn’t true). Then accuses the girl of being in the Illuminati due to her tattoos. And called her a “pedovore cannibal” because she listens to Tool. Accused her of using adrenochrome. 

Then, she blew up my phone asking me to pray for her...saying her temper got the better of her...then she said her neighbor was in the FBI and he’s “on top of this”. As well as she had a celebrity lawyer. She said “I’ve never been fired for asking about Maynard (lead singer of Tool)”. 

I share this because it has deeply disturbed me...at times I was wary of her theories and weird beliefs but didn’t believe she was crazy or anything, and honestly didn’t think she was on hard drugs like everyone else, she just seemed different.

Last night he told me I would be trying to convince him aliens are real in a few months, because that’s what is going to happen— he already knows what’s next in “the plan”, obviously🙄 

He is constantly saying specific events will happen and when they don’t come to fruition he acts like the plans must have been spoiled by the deep state. Last November he was certain a nuclear event would take place in Washington state, he even had a specific date for this event, but of course it never happened. I even recorded him saying this nonsense and showed it to him at a later date and there was total cognitive dissonance.

I promised his mom I would try and hang on and get him help, but I am realizing he cannot be helped. I can’t spend the rest of my life like this. It’s damaging me and my children. I am a worse parent than I should be because I am under constant stress from my husband. 

He talks like he is always in manic mode. He cannot hold a conversation with me without jumping to ten different non-related subjects. He cannot stay on topic and thinks he is so amazingly smart. I have taken to recording some conversations because I feel like no one will believe me. 

I am miserable and hopeless. I have no money to leave but I know I can’t stay. My parents aren’t rich enough to help me and I don’t have any solutions. All I know is I cannot stay, I’m falling apart and feel like I am going insane myself.

I don’t know how I got in this situation after so many years of a very happy and loving relationship. I feel so much anger and resentment. 

I am worried for my safety as he has now started getting guns and going to the shooting range. He uses words to dehumanize and villainize me. He calls me a communist-bolshevik— it’s bizarre but I recognize the intent to take the person out of the equation and just see them as an enemy. 

He is hateful and extremely anti-semitic. He literally thinks Jews are out to get him and control the world. 

I am at a total loss as to what my next steps should be considering I have no money. 

I am tired and weary and constantly depressed at this point. 

I have to get out. Am I crazy for worrying about my safety?? How do I protect my small children?  He is a good Dad, but he’s also insane. I want him to have a relationship with the children but how can I do so safely knowing he thinks these crazy things so deeply??

He is very anti covid vaccine and yesterday he came up with something about how he feels that LGBT people are getting more rights than him and how he doesn't like where things are going in this country.

I am way, way far left. I always knew that he was slightly more conservative than I am, but I still felt like we were mostly on the same page. He doesn't vote and he's always kind of rolled his eyes that I do. We're both rabid athiests. We've been married for 15 years. And then a month and a half ago he blindsides me out of nowhere that he wants a divorce. 

At first it was just that he didn't feel connected to me anymore and then he told me that he met someone at work and they like the same things and she's easy to talk to. He doesn't even try to talk to me. He admits that he's obsessed with this woman. I came to the conclusion that he's probably having a midlife crisis. She is much younger than I am. She's also religious.

Over the past month and a half it's been back and forth. We're going to try to work it out, wait nevermind, it's hopeless and we should divorce. It came out that what he really wants is just to run away and live in the forest (his words) because he doesn't like the state of the country and he just wants to escape. Then he says that they talk about these things at work and she agrees with him.

On the one hand I feel like He didn't start sliding into this weird place until he started obsessing over her. Like he's now obsessing over her and these conspiracies and weird right-wing ideas. But I feel like that robs him of his agency. He's not some blind sheep just following along. He's actively choosing to destroy his family over this. We have three children.

It never occured to me until this past month to ever consider that I married and made humans with the wrong person. But now, like my whole life is off balance, it's all jumbled up and broken and I feel so... hopeless and lost. I don't know what happened.

I'm not terribly concerned with changing his mind about his beliefs. I don't have to agree with him and as long as he's not being outright hateful, he's free to believe what he wants. I can think he's wrong without hating him for it. I just don't understand why he wants to implode his family over it.

My mom and sister have always been more observant than my dad. I'm pretty observant myself, and the more I read our religious texts the more I become disgusted with the current state of the world. My religion, and the community of people in it has really helped to ground me during these dark times. 

My dad spends way too much time on his phone, probably going on all kinds of sketchy websites and reading a lot of BS written by internet randos. He of course believes that the mainstream media is all deep-state and full of lies, so HIS sources must be the correct ones.   


A few months ago he was all about that 9/11 trutherism and 10 days of darkness rubbish. When (surprise!) it all turned out to be false, he went on to other venues of Q. Currently, he's an anti-masker and anti-vaxxer. He is also in this really creepy ""spiritual"" state where he talks about how positivity is so important and that everyone should only be happy all the time. He believes that tonic water cleans out an antenna in our brains (???) that helps us reach enlightenment. As a person with OCD, I know this is dumb because if I could really make bad things happen by not being happy all the time, a lot of people would be dead because of me failing to do my compulsions lol. Not to mention, whatever he reads is usually just unscientific garbage. I don't know why he believes it; he used to be very rational and smart. I'm losing my father.   


I told him that the ""spiritual"" stuff he's reading is lowkey considered idolatry in our religion, and he couldn't care less. He even said that the Talmud had many nasty things written in it.    


As someone who has had over 8 years of religious schooling, I KNOW that what he said is false. The antisemitic whackos he listens to online don't even know how to read the Talmud, let alone all the thousands of pages its books have.  My dad doesn't even know how to read Hebrew/Aramaic, and has never even touched one book of the Talmud.


I can't even spend alone time with him anymore, because eventually this topic always comes up. He has to make it his personality.    


Hanging out with him is hurting my mental health, but I love him.

I am a Boomer..75 years old.  My son..who is in his mid 50’s is smart..hard working..compassionate..funny..easy-going..generous person..he has been taken over by gradual Trump-ism morphed into Q-ism.  He is now angry and passionate about a lot.    
I first tried to challenge his thinking/beliefs..gently (mostly) but sometimes not so gently (which I now regret).  Here’s what I receive from him in text/conversations:  “The Media”  “The Left”. “The Democrats” (like all these millions of people are identical) “The Liberals” “Antifa” “The Deep State”...endless conspiracies to hurt Trumap (no matter what he has said or done...has Never criticized him) “COVID was a hoax to damage Trump” by the “Democrats or the Chinese”.  He said before the election “there won’t be any talk of COVID after Nov. 4th)”...”stolen election..there were hidden boxes of ballots under tables” (proven untrue).

Locally here...his anger (which surprises me) is directed to our nearest Big city because they are uber liberal (which this is true).  Our nearby/local buildings or schools are being re-named because of charges of racism.  This is a school he attended so it’s is personal to him as a “cancel culture” issue.Also the Civil War statues being torn down.

He is now talking of moving to a very conservative very Red State because he feels understood.

I am grieving because he has already distanced himself for me.  We used to talk almost every day..that is gone.  I miss that connection.

37641,37641,QAnonCasualties,odwot6,1,162,Mycosprite,I hereby publicly disown my sister,"I have been the 24/7 caregiver to my elderly mother in her home for the past 2 yrs. Never once has my sister,  who lives 40 minutes away, offered to help me. She is a Q Nut and believes every BS story she hears on all her ‘go to’ conspiracy sources. She has seen our mother once, briefly, since Covid started and that was over a year ago.  I had to take my Mom outside to sit and set a chair up for my sister 10 feet away b/c my sister refused to wear a mask.

My Mom had a mild heart attack a few weeks ago and I sent her to the ER. When I called my sister to tell her, she said it was my fault b/c  I “made” Mom get a Covid vaccine. No, my Mom very much *wanted* to get vaccinated. And I pointed out that our Mom got the vaccine 4 months ago and had a previous heart attack years before. I hung up as my sister continued her ranting and then realized that she had never even asked normal daughter questions like “Is Mom going to be OK?” or “Is it very serious? Can I go see her?”

Mom (who will be 102 yrs. old next week if she makes it) has been doing poorly since she returned from the hospital. My Mom is basically bedridden now and in diapers. I am alone 95% of the time destroying my already bad back. Still, my sister has not come to see my Mom or talk to her on the phone. She refuses to wear a mask to say “good-bye” to Mom.  “I can come and talk to her through the bedroom window,” she told me.

Today she called and said she wasn’t coming for her planned ‘window visit' as she was ‘tired’ and slept most of the day. I updated her on our Mom’s health status. How Mom has been up on &amp; off most nights and was awake all day the past 2 days w/ severe anxiety and how exhausted we both were. (I had to open the box from hospice w/ the big time meds today… something I was trying to avoid.) 

I cried to my sister, ”I hate to see Mom suffer so much; I’m trying everything. She shouldn’t have to suffer like this!” My sister replied, “Mom *didn’t* have to suffer like this.” It took a few seconds for my sleep deprived brain to get it. “What do you mean?” I asked my sister. She was silent. “OMG”, I thought. I hesitantly asked “Are you suggesting that she is suffering b/c of getting the Covid vaccine?” My sister quickly jumped in with her latest bad info about the vaccines and I screamed, “You are a f’ing evil lunatic!!” and hung up.

34347,34347,QAnonCasualties,m2ukq7,1,29,Dark_Queen9476,"BFF of 30+ years, lost to Q","This post is mainly meant to vent, and it's going to be long so don't feel like you have to read all of it.

I've been besties with my friend for over 30 years. She's babysat my children on her own vacations. I was a bridesmaid at her wedding. She was my first phone call when I found out my husband was cheating on me. She comforted me at my grandmother's funeral in 2019 and helped me with the shiva after. I was one of only three people who knew about her pregnancy and then the heartbreaking miscarriage. We've been each other's ride-or-die friends for decades.

I always knew she was conservative and loved Trump. But when I went to DC in 2017 for the Women's March, she'd text me (while wearing her MAGA hat) to make sure I was ok. During the entire T administration I defended her to others by explaining that she likes strong, dominant men, or that he represents her idea of the American Dream. I always bragged that I would never let politics come between us, even as other liberals I knew dropped friends and family members.

We never directly talked about politics, but we'd have this sort of passive-aggressive meme war on FB where I'd post something about why T was bad, then she'd post something about how T was awesome, and so on. Sometimes we'd engage directly.

She refused to wear a mask once Covid became an issue and told me I should absolutely send my kids to school in person. She posted photos of herself (unmasked of course) with Proud Boys at pro-T rallies. Still, I told myself that her generosity and kindness in our friendship was worth it.

Then came the insurrection. I don't know that she is an actual Q member, but she definitely had a pro-insurrection cover on her FB page and she absolutely posts all their conspiracies. She defended the rioters on 1/6. Despite me being Jewish and despite there being \*actual\* Nazis at the Capitol riots, she defended that whole nightmare. 

We've barely spoken since. She wished me a happy birthday. She wished my kid a happy birthday. I thanked her. That's about it. I keep muting her on FB because her posts give me very real anxiety. As I said, I don't know if she's actually \*in\* Q, but her posts sure echo a lot of what they preach. When I said I was excited to get the vaccine, she posted a link to an article by some quack about how the vaccines are killing children. She thinks that Black people get off easy in the media with their ""BLM riots"" while insisting that the insurrectionists were peaceful protesters.

I just can't with her right now. I'm exhausted from spending 4 years defending her yet being appalled at her points of view. Every once in a while she posts an anti-mask or anti-vax comment on my FB, which I have to ignore because I'm exhausted. But I miss my friend. I miss the person who was always my biggest cheerleader and supporter. I miss the woman who took the reins when I got a divorce so that I wouldn't be taken advantage of and talked me through my first online dating profile. I miss the sister-from-another-mister who let me take her ice skating for the first time even though she was like Bambi on the ice, and who happily went with me to a Hanukah party and took a photo with my rabbi. But there's just no talking to her anymore. Her world is very black-and-white with no room for nuance and it's only getting worse. She seems to always be on the attack, there's no ""conversation.""

For the last 3 months or so I always felt weird and guilty for not confronting her about the absurdity of some of the things she said to me were (Trump being the good guy, PizzaGate, satanist rituals with people drinking blood, etc.). Since we have a lot of things in common, I tried to brush it off and focused on the very things and topics we share, but a sense of guilt started to build up inside me, as if I was a hypocrite for not telling her I was definitely not buying some of the things she told me. 

I've always been skeptical about out governments and have followed some conspiracies in the past like 9/11 but have never delved that much into the rabbit hole. I consider myself more of a curious kinda guy but not one who would invest his whole life trying to find a silver lining. I can tell when things are getting absurd (like the whole 5G thing).

I was raised a catholic but renounced that cult/religion when I was a teenager. I'm currently an agnostic-atheist and I definitely consider myself somewhat spiritual (nature-driven). 

I wonder what makes us all around here immune to QAnon? I would think ""common sense"" but, how would we measure that? Are there any relevant studies on the main features or personality traits that make some people immune to cults or cultist behavior?

39538,39538,QAnonCasualties,pb0vm8,1,48,campingandwandering,Qanon neighbor,"My neighbor approached me in my parking lot last year, informing me of her Qanon beliefs. It was 90 degrees out, and she pleaded with me to watch a video titled Plandemic; at least, that’s what I believe it was called. I made up a quick excuse to take the information back to my house, agreed to watch the video later, and forgot about it for the time being. At the time, I just blew her off as someone who easily subscribed to conspiracy theories and was all in all relatively harmless. I may have been wrong. 

I have no idea if it was a coincidence or not, but she ran back into me the day I received my first vaccine back in April. She asked me the standard question all anti-vaxers seem to follow. Did you have any side effects? Did you pay for it? Weren’t you worried about being injected with a vaccine that would change your DNA? 

Now I just learned she confronted my father when he came to visit last week. She knows him from past interactions and decided to share her new views. From what he told me, she has fallen down the rabbit hole and now is full-on Qanon. He’s a Vietnam vet and is not easily shaken, but her conversation concerned him. Here are a few facts she shared. 

* Trump will be reinstalled as president in September. 
* Democrats have been caught drinking blood. 
* The capitol riot was edited to make the Republicans look bad. 
* Covid does not cause death. 
* God is returning, and what is coming is all in his plan. 

Now, this is where I am at a cross roads per se. She’s actually not a bad person. I’ve known her for ten years and actually had decent conversations with her in the past. She comes from an abusive background; she’s admitted to me she has a mental disease, and she has no formal education after ninth grade. 

What I would like to do is figure out a resource that may be able to reach out to her. I’m thinking of an organization that could help her see the forest over the trees. As I’ve stated before, I believe she’s a good person at heart but sadly has been swept away with all the conspiracy theories she has run into on social media. I blame Facebook and others for preying on her. 

Any advice would be beneficial.

36441,36441,QAnonCasualties,ni3npj,1,10,WildCaterpillar19,"When the grief won't quit, here's what I'm learning","My parents long ago fell for all the QAnon-related lies, though they deny Q itself is a thing. Go figure. I share the following as an example of how those caught in conspiracy theories become blinded to the ways their ignorance assaults others who care for them.

**Here's what happened.**

My sister and her husband recently had a baby, knowing full-well they were not in a position to afford childcare and that they would be relying on my QAnon mom to watch their newborn. My sister and BIL told me they didn't believe in any of the conspiracy theories but that they were in an awkward position because they depended on her to watch their newborn. They said they had told mom they disagreed with her beliefs and for her to please stop texting links to articles related to conspiracy theories and that they would happily discuss other topics. They told me they were essentially silencing her and that she seemed to be fine with it. 

After watching a documentary about cults, I learned that when people who are caught up in cults feel silenced by their loved ones, they cleave to the lies even more. At the same time, I read the news story from 5 weeks+ ago of a California woman who killed her kids because she was so afraid they would get caught up in the sex pedophilia ring she believed was going to get to her children ([https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-17/mother-unraveled-in-depression-qanon-style-conspiracies-in-months-before-she-killed-3-kids](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-04-17/mother-unraveled-in-depression-qanon-style-conspiracies-in-months-before-she-killed-3-kids)). 

So I called my sister and gently started to encourage her that maybe we shouldn't silence our mother (because I believed she was also silencing her, since she told me she was), and she got defensive and I told her we didn't have to keep talking about, that the only reason I brought it up was because people who feel silenced sometimes do not behave in normal ways. I started to mention the story of the California woman and she lost it. Her tears could not be consoled; then came hysterical screaming. The last thing I wanted to do was upset her, but that just so happened to be the news story that broke that day and came to my mind as an example of people being silenced. I don't think my mother would actually harm her child, but I also thought my sister and I were on the same page about silencing her. Now, my brother-in-law has cut me off from my sister and essentially told me I'm not allowed to communicate with them anymore because I upset his wife so much. 

I told my mother what happened, so I could get my side of the story out first since I knew it would circle back, and she said she was incredibly insulted I thought she was part of a cult, and that my sister and BIL have said all along they do agree with her but that they just don't like talking about it because it makes them fearful.

**The deeper moral of the story?** QAnon breeds liars and brings out the worst in people. I'm so thankful for my husband who provides a stable homelife and for YouTube shows like David Pakman that describe news with effective commentary. Getting to share my story helps as well.

When I visit the Facebook community page, it is full of militant Qanon adherents.

In the middle of a global pandemic,
They are ranting and raving.

Covid is a hoax.
Vaccines are poisonous, dangerous...
Vaccines have been created by Bill Gates to put microchips and poisons in our body, because Bill Gates has a depopulation agenda.
Vaccines contain microchips.
Vaccines cause cancer.

Donald Trump is a hero.
Donald Trump is taking down the pedophile cabal from the inside out.
Donald Trump has already had many of the pedophiles secretly arrested.

Obama was trafficking children in the white house.
Michelle Obama is a transexual, real name Michael.

And on and on the rediculous, Qanon originated conspiracy theories go...

If you express an opinion that is contrary to any of this, they aggressively threaten and attack you, bullying you to shut you up.

This is a small hippy town. 
These people are crazy.
But it's the majority.
The so called peace love and brown rice brigade, have become fervent fascists. 
Anyone who doesn't strictly adhere to this brand of extreme conspiracy and anti establishment doctrine, is quickly labelled.

They tear you down, call you brainwashed, ignorant, accuse you of genocide. 

There is no reasoning with these people and they have absolutely taken over the entire town, to the point where it seems all the normal people, with critical thinking skills, who refrain from jumping to outlandish conclusions, are now silenced.

I moved from there 9 months ago.
The place I'm living, is working class people, farmers etc. Who it seems have not lost their minds. 

I kind of hope all these nut jobs get covid as a reality check. 
But I know that's a bit extreme and it's not what I hope at all.

With recent outbreaks, and now the initiation of mass vaccinations, there is a a very real risk though, that could very well be the case.  And it will be the most vulnerable who suffer as a result.
The old, the sick,and those who don't have it in them to fight back against this new, crazed status quo.

And what's it all in aid of? 
Small minded people, with huge egos, bullshitting themselves and everyone around them, that they are intellectually superior, and gave all the answers.

She is my best friend and I know she feels very depressed and suicidal because of this.  I wanted to keep talking with her because I am scared that she will hurt herself if she feels too alone in this. 
I also recommended her to talk to a doctor but she refuses because she doesn’t want to be seen as crazy, she thinks this is like the WW2 and she is fighting for our freedom and we are all blind.

I allowed her to send me all these videos and articles, just so she knows she is not the only one who knows about this but not everyone looks at it the same way she does. So I read and watch everything and I ask her critical questions that can debunk the whole article. But then she gets angry at me and says that I am just too blind to see it, and that if I would really read éverything she reads that I would agree with her. 
This has been going on and off for the past year and I am just so tired about it. I realized theres nothing I can do to make her question herself or make her feel better and it is draining my own energy. 

I want to stop talking to her about this because it gets really frustrating and I know she will only believe things that confirm her own ideas. But I am so scared of letting go of this little grip on her that I still have, I know I was the only one she could talk to about this and what if she gets too lonely and will hurt herself.

We live 1.5 hours away from them and he’s a drinker, likes to be home to drink and we have 2 small kids so usually it’s just my mom that comes up and visits us alone. My mom and I are super close. My mom converted to Democrat this election. Voted blue, is attending a womans March with me, etc. 

Now her husband has always been the type to be like like “fuck politics idc” blah blah. Well this last visit something was just …different. First off he was spouting off to my fiancé and I about vaccine conspiracies.. he refuses to get it bc vaccine bad but apparently nicotine &amp; alcohol good idk. He has a Fox News app on his phone and at one point he made a Twitter (so weird for a guy with NO social media at all) and was following some Fox News anchors. Only reason I even know that is bc he showed up on my suggestions from my contacts list so I looked because I thought it was weird af he popped up. Then he got tipsy and was making some questionable comments to my fiancé who is a POC (Hispanic). It was out of character bc he never usually does that and him and my fiancé are actually very cool with each other typically. 

I talked to my mom about this and although I love her she is the type to bury her head in the sand a bit. She just says he’s dumb and doesn’t want to get the vax but she just ignores his crazy shit.

Though I haven’t had a spare moment to do too much research, I’ve gathered that he’s encouraged listeners to try and catch COVID-19 (???). And, of course, he seems to be against mask wearing and vaccines. 

The main issue here is that my Aunt frequently visits my 85 year old Grandma, who is usually pretty safe when it comes to covid precautions. (Outside of seeing my Aunt regularly.) It’s upsetting, to say the least. My Mom is adamant about making sure my Aunt doesn’t give my Grandma covid, but we really don’t know if my Aunt’s going to do anything unsafe or irresponsible. 

On another note, I’ve noticed that a lot of my Aunt’s pre-QAnon beliefs like all natural/organic eating, various new health crazes, homeopathy, and devout Catholicism ended up naturally meshing with a lot of Q beliefs. (...She believes that if you eat healthy enough, you’re 100% immune to cancer. Yeah.) 

So- anyone else’s Q family/friends come from a place of anti-science, but with a “all-natural” sort of vibe? My Aunt was always an “artsy hippy” to me, but I never realized that even her pre-Q beliefs were sinister until now. 

(Context: I’m a young adult; my experience speaking to her as a fellow adult has been limited. I’m sure I’d have known her beliefs were always dangerous MUCH sooner if I’d been an adult the whole time I’d known her.

32354,32354,QAnonCasualties,l5cu0j,1,1,ITriedToBeOriginal,I think I got my friend out before it was too late.,"I'm not sure if my story belongs here, but I wanted to share it.

I don't think my friend was ever fully into Q. He loves conspiracy theories and sometimes falls for bits of them, like saying about the Vegas shooting, ""I don't doubt he did it, but he must have had help and he was just the fall guy.""

He's smart enough to know the 5G and Vaccine Tracker crap his family believes is utter nonsense, but every once in a while he would say something vaguely Q-ish. Something like, ""Trump has some kind of grand plan, it just isn't the time to start it yet."" Or, ""I don't think the Pizzagate 

Now, I love debating politics, much to my father-in-law's annoyance. It's how I grew up. Everyone in my family was able to freely state their own ideas with the understanding that the rest of us would do our best to poke holes in their logic and you had to defend your position. As well as loving a good debate, I am also a self proclaimed, ""leftist nutjob."" Personally I think Americanism such as the Pledge of Allegiance is cult-like and dangerous, countries shouldn't exist, and our currency should be based on something more substantial and easily regulated than the hopes and wishes of a select few people who's best interests are to squeeze every resource out of the lives of people and the very planet itself. I am very used to having to back up my arguments against a room full of people who disagree with me.

My friend has never had this kind of interaction with people, but he himself says he enjoys the challenge of putting up a fight for your ideas rather than just having someone automatically agree with you.

Now, my friend and I were having a debate about guns. I personally don't like guns, but I'm fine with other people having them. With a history of depression I just don't think I can trust myself with a firearm in the house. Our conversation went something like this.

Me: Nobody on the left has ever wanted to take your guns away, that has always been a Right-wing scare tactic. What we want is proper education, licensing, and registration for firearms. The same as a car, different sizes of vehicles need different amounts of training depending on the danger they introduce to people and property, as well as you must register those vehicles to your name so they may be accounted for in case of theft or wrongdoing.

Him: Well if you are going to argue for education of firearms, I say that firearm safety should be taught in schools. It's part of the constitution, so should be included in the public education curriculum.

Me: If we're going to bring Constitutional literalism into this, I say we add onto that Religious Studies classes, and not just Christian Studies, but a complete education on the top ten religions of the world so that people can make informed decisions on what they want to follow in their faith if they choose to follow any at all.

Him: ......I think I agree with you.....

That small agreement opened a small hole of doubt into his world view. We discussed how he claims to support things like gay and Trans rights yet votes for people who do their best to treat those communities as sub-human. We talked about the BLM movement, and I explained to him what systematic racism really is, and how events from hundreds of years ago can still be seen and felt today. He had no idea what Red-Lining or Black Wall Street were. He believes that drugs are a symptom of something like mental health problems, addiction, or pain management when people have lack of access to proper health care, and I asked him why he voted for people who view people who use drugs as criminals rather than victims and would rather lock them in a cell than get them the treatment they need.

Then, today, to my surprise, before we talked about anything else he told me, ""I'm switching parties. I feel like I've been shooting myself in the foot just because I've always been told it's what I'm supposed to do.""

I don't know what this means for his future, and I don't know what this means for his relationship with his family, but that's already on shaky ground as it is for other reasons. I hope he continues to educate himself on his own beliefs, and I hope we continue to debate in the future.",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l5cu0j/i_think_i_got_my_friend_out_before_it_was_too_late/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/l5cu0j/i_think_i_got_my_friend_out_before_it_was_too_late/,1.0,2021-01-26 12:16:04

 Shitty McJobs that dont pay the bills, Wallstreet firms buying up housing enmasse making affordable housing unobtainable, medical.bills that are far outside the norm with no patient protections against price gouging, education costs that have sunk a generation of working Americans in huge amounts of debt (discouraging others to obtain higher education too btw),  and 72 million voting Americans on one side, who support a seizure of power and forcing Americans like me ""to submit to their rule"", radicalized, racist and hatred driven police in every corner (I watched Portland Cops allow in Trump thugs, license plates covered, to mace and paintball portland anti-racism/police brutality protesters without stopping but encouraging them).

Add in their vile and vicious, fear and hatred driven propaganda against Americans like me...I think theyre angling the country towards a genocide and awful conclusion. It WILL get worse before it gets better.

All to prove that ""covid is no worse than the flu"". I'm the only member of the family he wasn't able to expose because I already have a poor relationship with him and don't see him aside from negotiated holidays in conjunction with my sister as a form of emotional support. We were planning on doing an outside in public christmas with the man in order to ensure he would have to wear a mask and couldn't explode in public and make a scene. The employee he gave covid to is the one who warned my sister and I that he had covid. He would have gone through a christmas gathering socially distanced knowing he was infected and possibly trying to expose us to covid because of his sick mental state. I reported his business to the state but I don't know what else I can do. 

My sister and brother in law are both health care workers. My brother in law was just vaccinated and is showing ""reactions"" but we don't honestly know if it's because of the vaccine or covid because of the overlap of exposure.

30453,30453,QAnonCasualties,kutoqv,2,7,quorumvia,Just need to vent about my immigrant Q parents and the sadness &amp; resentment I feel towards them,"First time poster here, really grateful to have found this community and know that I’m not alone.

I recently moved back home due to school/work/COVID, and I’m starting to realize just how far gone my Qparents are. They’ve always been very religious and far-right, but I didn’t know that they bought into QAnon until I started living with them. They idolize Trump, Lin Wood, and Sidney Powell while constantly going off about how the election was stolen (we live in Canada). I can’t even type out some of the things they believe because I find them so abhorrent. They’ve reacted very badly to the news about Q accounts being purged off social media, etc., and have been going on about how the world is ending because of “censorship” but “God knows who the evil people are”. I’m openly very left on the political spectrum so we’ve made a point to not discuss politics in front of each other because is just turns into an emotional argument. I’ve tried to share facts and reason with them, but logic literally means nothing to them because they so deeply believe that everything is fake or manipulated. I try to keep to myself in my room most of the time, but my house is small with thin walls and it feels like I literally can’t escape their rants about their Q beliefs.

It’s just been so exhausting because it’s stressful enough hearing the vitriol and anger, but it’s also just made me feel really sad about their mental state. I feel a lot of resentment towards them because their beliefs and values are pretty much the antithesis of what’s important to me, and a part of me just wants to cut them off completely for my own sanity’s sake. At the same time though, I’m literally the only person grounding them in reality and I feel like I can’t abandon them. I’m their only child, and they’re immigrants without any friends here. They rarely keep in touch with family (they all live overseas &amp; communicate via email or phone call once every couple of months kind of deal), and don’t socialize with anyone else. My dad works alone and my mom is currently unemployed, so it’s not hyperbole when I say that they spend all their time at home ranting together in an endless echo chamber of their beliefs.

It’s tough because I know they’ve sacrificed a lot for me, and despite all the resentment I feel, I still love them and I know they love me too. It’s heartbreaking to see them so isolated and hateful, but I don’t know what else I can do since our conversations don’t go anywhere. I just don’t understand how they can subscribe to so many delusional and harmful beliefs, especially as immigrants and as supposed Christians. 

Thanks for letting me rant, sending my heart out to others going through similar things ❤️",True,self.QAnonCasualties,https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/kutoqv/just_need_to_vent_about_my_immigrant_q_parents/,/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/kutoqv/just_need_to_vent_about_my_immigrant_q_parents/,1.0,2021-01-11 03:00:24
