41714,41714,ReQovery,i4nyot,1,33,Rick_James_Lich,How to argue with Qanon believers,"Thought I'd make a thread about this since it's a big issue for many folks out there, in particular it can be really frustrating having a loved one or friend believe in the Qanon Conspiracy and convincing them otherwise can often appear to be an impossible task. While I have my own suggestions, I'd be interested in other people putting in feedback on what has worked for them or approaches they are trying to use in general. That being said, here's a list of the points I try to make when talking with a Qanon believer:

1. First above all else, be respectful. Nobody likes being told that they are stupid, or that they are being conned. Be mindful that when debating with someone, it is a two way street and you must always be willing to listen. In fact the act of listening alone can often give you credibility with the person that you are trying to sway. It shows that you are genuine and interested in what they have to say.

2. Try to use steel man arguments - this part is a pain in the ass, but don't make weak versions of their arguments and attack those. Build up their argument as strongly as possible and then attack that. 

3. Don't try to get them to change their mind on politics in general. Start off small here, there's enough to chew on with the Qaon theories alone. Rome was not built in a day, and all too often there are some that are so wrapped up in the idea of this conspiracy that they are fully convinced it is real. So attack this first as opposed to convincing them not to vote for Trump.

4. Take the time to be knowledgeable on the Qanon conspiracy. This part will suck but in order to refute the claims, it's important to know what you are talking about. 

That being said what I've been trying to do is start by explaining to the person I am talking how the conspiracy theory originated itself - on a troll forum, 4chan, that has hosted child pornography itself. I explain the absurdity of the notion that a high clearance government agent frequents such an absurd site, as opposed to using a more official means of getting their message across.

From there I point out the vast number of inconsitencies, where it's an ""electrical power outage that will wipe out the interview for a week"" or that the ""Storm"" has been said to be close by for years now yet Trump is close to being done with his first term and we have not seen anything close to what Qanon is proclaiming will happen.

From there I try to bring up the pedophilia rumors, turning it against Trump with his close ties to Jeffrey Epstein, sexual assault allegations, and other stories such as him frequenting the changing rooms for the Miss Teen Universe Pageants. More importantly bring up that for such a heavy accusation as pedophilia, concrete proof is required. And taking the letters in someone's name and adding them up does not constitute proof in any form. 

I also recommend asking the person to present a reason for why to believe in Qanon. I find many believers don't get asked this type of thing. Often it can give you a really easy way to point out discrepancies. While I have a template, I try to tailor my talking points based on my audience and what they are saying to me.

I hope this might help out someone that has a loved one that they want to help.

41718,41718,ReQovery,iscb1o,18,23,d-_-bored-_-b,Not sure where to start,"I just have to vent, I'm not angry at Q or whoever, idc about them, I stopped being angry at myself for believing in it and all other craziness that came with it.

But is it just me? Or does anyone else who used to follow Q get particularly ruffled by current Q anon followers?

Like I think we former Q followers have actually a really unique perspective, hear me out, because for most people Qultists can just dismiss then by saying ""Oh you're just ignorant, or brainwashed or a sheep"" right, but they **cannot** say that to us?

We were there, before them in most cases, longer than them in almost all cases, we *know* everything they think they know and then some. 

I dunno I'm probably just projecting, but the thing annoys me the most is even by Q's own rules they don't have a leg to stand on. Does anyone else remember how big a deal ""No Outside Comms"" was?

Even though Q only mentioned it once, the whole community repeated it ad neasuem for months and years. But then 8chan got taken down, 8kun is not 8chan. What the hell happened to no outside comms?

/rant

Sorry guys there's just so many things like this that probably annoy me more than anything, the lack of their own internal logic within the movement, even accepting everything Q says true, it literally cannot be true. It's like as if Q said ""This sentence is a lie"".

41719,41719,ReQovery,isouch,1,22,Blazekeen42,So I used to follow Pizzagate...,"It makes me cringe to think about how in 2016 I was telling my friends about this ""Pizzagate"" scandal that was soon going to rock the global political landscape. In a way though, maybe I was right, just not in the way I had envisioned.

I was radicalized by Reddit, specifically the r/conspiracy subreddit. I've always had a penchant for believing outlandish conspiracies that can't be disproved so I used to like going there to find new rabbit holes to fall into. Anyone else who frequented there in 2016 will remember how it was pretty much non-stop pizzagate posts about how Seth Rich had been murdered, Hillary and the DNC had cheated Bernie, and Podesta and other high-profile DNC members were secretly pedophiles. I fell for the Podesta emails ""secret code"" pretty hard, and in retrospect I think it was mainly a result of feeling disillusioned by how I perceived the DNC had treated my favored candidate in the primaries, Bernie Sanders. I wanted so badly for him to win and felt like he was such a better candidate, that the theories about Podesta and Clinton conspiring to take him down had to be the answer for why he didn't receive the nomination. 

It's funny because you read the Podesta emails with no context and there's really no indication of any weird stuff. But then you read it through a biased lens of ""this guy is a criminal willing to conspire against my candidate"" and suddenly the walnut sauce takes on a whole new meaning.

I never took it as a pro-Trump, right-wing conspiracy as much as I did an anti-Clinton conspiracy, until it morphed into the QAnon stuff. I'm actually somewhat glad it openly became ""DEMS ARE BABY KILLERS, TRUMP IS GOD"" because it is now so ridiculously obvious that it's Republican propaganda and that's when I fell off the pizzagate train. With recent news that Roger Stone deliberately dropped the Podesta emails right as Trump's Access Hollywood tape came out, it's pretty obvious that the pizzagate stuff was a precursor to the Q propaganda so I feel bad about falling for it, but to their credit they made it a lot less obvious in 2016. It was less about Trump being a ""patriot"" and more about just suppressing potential Clinton voters. With Trump's obvious connections to Epstein, I'm amazed at how people can believe QAnon when it is so pro-Trump. 

I'm actually really interested to hear from others about this. Anyone else follow Pizzagate but assumed that Trump was also involved with the whole ""elites are satanic pedophiles"" schtick, only to wake up to the obvious lies after it shifted into ""Trump is working to save us all""? If it had continued as a fringe conspiracy that all politicians are in on some trafficking and drug rings, I probably would still be a believer today. The QAnon posts are just so obviously biased that I can't believe people take it seriously, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised because I myself believed some weird stuff circa 2016.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/isouch/so_i_used_to_follow_pizzagate/,/r/ReQovery/comments/isouch/so_i_used_to_follow_pizzagate/,1.0,2020-09-14 16:53:22

My name is Molly and I’m the host of Out of the Woods, a podcast for stories about not-quite-cults but not-quite-not-cults. People share their experiences being strong believers in something--a religion, an ideology, a community, anything--and share how they came to realize it was, well...cult-ish. 

I’d be really interested to interview someone who was involved in QAnon and then left it behind. I want to emphasize that the way I approach all of my guests is with compassion and curiosity, and I have no interest in condemning people who once believed in any sort of ideology / conspiracy and decided to leave.

I want to talk to a former believer, and if they wanted to, I would also be open to interviewing a loved one either as a separate episode or on the same call. 

It can of course be 100% anonymous, no name or identifying info (except your voice). I always offer my guests the option of listening to the episode before I publish it, too. 

To get a sense of the podcast, here are some topics I have / will be covering so far...
- Online social justice culture 
- Evangelical Christianity 
- Anarcho-primitivist live-in protest sites 
- Fat acceptance movement 
- Spiritual cults 
- Wellness magical thinking &amp; conspiracy theories 
- Ivy League academia 

If you are interested, please email outofthewoods@gmail.com, or you can DM me on Instagram @outofthewoodspod.

I dipped my toes into QAnon a long, long time ago, before it became so politically relevant, and the part about Trump being our saviour or whatever, wasn't really the dominant theme. So I came here to ask the opinion of people who were open to the QAnon theories at one point, like myself, but can't be a part of it now, like myself.

From where I'm sitting it looks like the whole thing was essentially grabbed up opportunistically and twisted into a political tool for the right wing. The thing is, I feel like this goes beyond politics. A conspiracy of such vastness would likely not be contained within a single party, or absent from another. The audacity and enormity of the ideas behind QAnon are just too difficult to argue from the narrow-minded perspective of bipartisanship.

So I guess I'll propose a grander conspiracy theory: the CIA came along and trampled on this theory by spinning it as something only believed by crackpot conservative fools, and adding Trump into the mix. I'd love to hear some thoughts on this perspective.

41771,41771,ReQovery,jz4np7,1,5,PoliticalAndy7,QAnon almost had my mother... almost.,"A few years ago my mother began a conversation with the infamous line, “Have you heard about Pizza Gate?” A cousin of mine had sent her some YouTube videos of the conspiracy that was just at the beginnings of its origin. At that time, I told her how ridiculous it all was, how much it would take for the cover up, and so on, trying my best to make an appeal to reality. Fortunately, she was convinced by my argument. 

Both of my parents and most of my extended family are conservatives and pro-Trump voters, but they are open to discussion and disagreement. Thinking about the Pizza Gate discussion, I can see how close members of my family were to being drawn into the Qanon adjacent belief structure. Of course, I get frustrated with their Trump allegiance at times, but at least, I can still talk to them without being dismissed and seen as the enemy. 

For those of you who are dealing with that response, I can’t imagine the pain and heartbreak that you are dealing with. I wish I could say that a good polemical argument could convince them otherwise (I was fortunate to catch it early on), but it seems like the Qanon worldview is cultish in its capacity to see disagreement itself as proof of the rightness of Qanon beliefs. This really is a tragedy, and those who propagate these conspiracies and manipulate others with them should bear the brunt of the judgment.

My name is David Gilbert and I'm a journalist with VICE News.

As the holidays approach, families and friends are planning to get together, and for many it could be the first time they come face to face with a person in their family or circle of friends who has begun following QAnon.

I am writing a piece looking at how best to approach this situation and I was wondering if anyone here had any experience in this area they would like to share?

* Are there things you should/should not do?
* Do you have any tips on how best to approach the topic?
* As a recovered QAnon follower, what did you find the best approach?
* Should you just avoid it completely?
* Has anyone successfully convinced someone to quit QAnon?

Happy to speak here on chat or private message, or you can reach me on email at [david.gilbert@vice.com](mailto:david.gilbert@vice.om) if that's easier.

Thanks

David

I am currently working on a semester-long project on QAnon for an undergrad anthropology class, and I need some interviews for it. If any of you would like to be interviewed/tell your story over messaging or email, please let me know! The interviews will be 100% anonymous, and you can be as detailed or vague as you are comfortable with. The information and stories I receive will only be seen by my professor and my classmates, and all identifying information will be changed. One of the things I want to achieve in this project is to study the human side of QAnon and humanize the people that end up sucked into it in order to better understand the movement. So getting a few interviews would mean a lot to me and really help out my project.

41781,41781,ReQovery,k5h4x4,1,23,danica-dav,"I’m on the fence here, help!","Okay I don’t really even know how to start. 
I’ve always grown up in a conservative household, my parents were previously Democrats but hardship with their business and having kids led them elsewhere. This I respect, I believe in republican views separate from the theories of Q.  
A few things to understand, I’m not really into Q. My parents are. 
My mom is incredibly educated, she’s always been above average but went back to school when she was 40 and has excelled, she went through UofM and then graduate school, and is now a professor herself. 
So knowing my moms background and then knowing her personally, she’s not stupid. She is definitely no fool. That being said my dad is just as smart. 
But she is all sorts of wrapped up in Q, not the super unbelievers shit like the flat earth and stuff just the more political side. 
I think it began when I was 11, she pulled me out of public school because of a conversation she had with her professor about how bad the school systems are. Something about common core. Fair enough. But she wouldn’t let me go back no matter my protest, so that sucked lol. 

She tells me things about it a lot but I’m a little squirrelly and can’t manage to keep my attention on something long enough to get involved in it, so I never got dragged into it myself, even when I “tried”. But I’ve in part, sided with her. It does sound believable all things considered, not to mention that addicting “I’m part of something huge and the general population isn’t” feeling. 
I ran across this group literally looking for Q related posts but got to reading.. I didn’t even know people referred to it as a cult. Now I’m curious. 

I can see how it appeals to people; it’s easy to believe the world really just is that bad. When you get wrapped up in it, with everything they have to offer theory wise, it sounds completely fathomable. And anything anyone else says is written off as the lies they’re fighting against, a completely dishonest media, government and society.
So I do not think all of these Q followers are stupid or bad people, but if it’s true Q is a fraud, they’ve simply been taken advantage of trying to do the right thing. Fight the right fight.
If it’s true Q is true. Then y’all are the brainwashed ones coinciding with media. 
I don’t know what to think. I really can’t stand politics, and I don’t like much about either side. I hate how our society has grown so pathetically sensitive and politically correct. I realllyyyy dislike the lefts social structure, and the right is so... well you probably get it. Icky 
The lies from both sides are just.. Jesus Christ. 

There is so much information everywhere, false, not false, maybe false? 

So here is where I need help.

41791,41791,ReQovery,kdinpq,1,28,resistthemadness,"My story, I was never into Qanon but I did used to believe in NWO and was a (former) Trump supporter with some pretty shitty ideologies.","First things first I want to sincerely congratulate everybody here for getting themselves out of that sick deceptive cult.

I'm a 25 year old Canadian guy, politically speaking i'm very unsure of myself still but I can't wait to see that fascist orange POS gone come January. I used to follow NWO conspiracies and hearing Trump being blasted by the ""lying media"" caused me to fall in love with him. I started to have some pretty fascist views over the course of his presidency thank's to disinformation I was eating up but fast forward to the beginning of the pandemic and that's when things began to change for me. I saw the rise of COVID-19 denialism and that was too much for me, how could people deny the existense of an ongoing worldwide crisis when people are dying alone on ventilators unable to be with their loved ones? I actually lost my favourite aunt to covid in May, the last time I saw her was 2009 as she lived in Florida, if not for the pandemic happening she would have been finally coming to visit but now that will not be happening, her death was listed as a heart attack but I don't buy it for one bit. She was rushed to the hospital after waking up in respritory distress and passed several days later when taken off life support, if you want an ACTUAL conspiracy Florida has been trying to downplay their covid deaths.

I was almost ready to say fuck Trump at that point but then right after that the George Floyd protests happened, Antifa and BLM were back in the spotlight raising hell and I was further pushed back towards the pro fascist train I even praised the Kenosha shooter for awhile. Although I never got into COVID denial and always despised anti maskers.

I can't exatcly put my finger on when I started to finally wake up but actually researching qanon helped wake me up. I'd heard Q mentioned before but never looked into the specifics I loosely believed some of it myself to the extent that Trump was anti NWO. Then I started reasearching what qultists believe. As someone who is fascinated by Satanism as well as the occult, paranormal ect. I found the notion that democrats were Satanic pedophile cannibals or whatever it is to be extremely laughable, nonetheless that they could conspire with eachother in a nation full of armed to the teeth evangelical Christians without someone catching on. I then delved further into it and it occured to me that a huge part of Trump's base believed in this shit and how they were using it to attempt to delegitimize an actual global health crisis the likes of which we've never seen.

I laughed when Trump got covid genuinely hoping he would be gone early and 6 feet under from it and by the time election day rolled around I was DONE! The man I once loved and damn near worshiped like a god had become a evil vile piece of shit who I felt nothing but the purest most bitter hatred for, I felt angry and decieved, how could I have been so fucking stupid? Living in Canada I didn't vote but I was rooting for Biden. I moved over to reddit and started spending less time on facebook as the qultists and fascists went even more unhinged post Trump's election loss. I joined r/Qult_Headquarters and became a regular poster as well as browsed r/ParlerWatch and saw some pretty horrifying shit as well as the depressing stories that r/QAnonCasualties had to offer.

Now I've decided to come here to share my story of how I fell for the cult of orange, and how I finally got out. I might never have escaped if it wasn't for the pandemic and seeing the American Nazi party begin to unravel itself in the face of an apocalyptic global health crisis, some silver lining to these tragic times.✊✌️",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/kdinpq/my_story_i_was_never_into_qanon_but_i_did_used_to/,/r/ReQovery/comments/kdinpq/my_story_i_was_never_into_qanon_but_i_did_used_to/,1.0,2020-12-15 09:29:53

41793,41793,ReQovery,kf7z10,8,27,cracked_egg_irl,I am a trans woman who voted for Trump in 2016. I voted for Obama in 2012 and Biden in 2020. My story.,"I'm so glad to have found this place! I felt so alone in casting out my Trumpism. I wanted a place to share this journey I had. I never went for QAnon, but I know I would have. I saved and shared a lot of Pizzagate memes on /pol/ so it's almost a guarantee I would have if I hadn't gotten better.

So, in 2008, as much as I wanted to vote for Obama, I was sadly 17 years old during this election. I attended a very conservative, rural high school and I remember we even had a mock election in which McCain had won. 

4 years later, I'm a senior in college. Though I'm still in the South, I've learned a lot. My friends are liberal, facebook is taking off, I've seen enough liberal info on there, voting for Obama again was a no-brainer. I considered myself your average Democrat at the time.

And then, I got a job. Things changed a _lot_ for me. I worked for a pretty cool liberal tech company. And for a while, it was good. It was a chill place and we used Slack to communicate, and it was chill enough that a meme or two was totally cool. There was a girl, we'll call her Zoey. I could hear her giggles from across the room when I posted a meme. Emboldened, I started sending her some memes directly. 

We trade numbers, we hook up, we date. I start finding ""spicy"" memes. They started lightly, stuff you'd find on dark parts of reddit. Slowly but surely, I'm headed to /b/ and the like and finding ""politically incorrect"" stuff. Zoey's a big fan too. They slowly become more tinged with racism, homophobia, antisemitism, misogyny, and all the ilk you can imagine. Slowly through all these jokes, we start to spiral into seeing the ""truth"" in everything.

Then in 2015, Trump announced his candidacy. Of course, like many, we treated it as a fucking joke. And since we made fun of everything, joking about Trump's presidency was following suit. I honestly remember an /r/AskReddit post that got me. It was something like ""People who are seriously supporting Donald Trump, why?"" (and this was when he was a joke candidate) And someone posted some crap about how the others are bad and Trump isn't like them. Well, that got me to thinking, ""well, why the hell not?""

I went to /r/the_donald back when it was in the low 10s of thousands of subscribers in 2015. Back then, it was people just joking about Trump. And memes. Memes I started sharing with Zoey. We sarcastically said how we were totally about Trump to each other. 

But in time, things started changing. Trump started gaining actual political steam. It was far before the primaries, but he was polling well. I was continuing to pile on the shit memes with Zoey and also generally being a pretty bad partner, all things considered. But she loved those memes. And I kept them coming.

Then before the primaries, like laaate 2015, early 2016, I had another friend, we'll call him Aaron. Aaron was on the same type of logic as me. We were both joking sarcastically about how we like Trump. And he proposed the idea of sarcastically going to a Trump rally. The one that's in my city in a couple weeks. I agreed, let's see Trump be dumb.

We were among the first in line. We brought our 3DSes and played pokemon while waiting. I'm not fucking joking lmao. We showed up like 2-3 hours early, seriously. Doors open, we go into a huge room, and we get within the first few rows. It's standing room only and it becomes incredibly tight. 

We wait a while longer and he comes out. And there seriously is something about his campaigning, his speech. He may be a shitbag but he sure does know how to manipulate crowds at a deep psychological level. I remember he first talked about the wall. ""We're gonna build a wall, and who is going to pay?"" he said expectantly. ""MEXICO!"" the crowd shouted. I had no idea about any of this, but when the crowd so around me is attuned and answers his question... it just builds something in you. Shame, perhaps? In any case, going to this rally, while Aaron and I giggled like hell at some of the stupid antics (there was some guitar player who played something so ridiculous we just laughed at how dumb it was). We had our entertainment. But with us, we took an unconscious taint that turned myself from Trump-joking, to full on Trump supporter. We even bought some dumb ripoff merch. I got on Trump's list at some point and donated like $25 so I could get some dumb ""Trump card"" lmao. I bought a MAGA hat and wore it around just to piss people off.

Any time I talked about Trump, I was Schrodinger's douchebag. When the audience took what I said seriously, it was just a joke. When they laughed at the joke, I actually meant it. I saw Trump stickers, I went crazy. Aaron was ready to enable me with a laugh. Zoey caught on with the picture soon enough. She stuck with it.

What I realized had happened was, all my racism was awoken over this long period of time. I grew up in the South. In the US. There was so much covert racism in TV, movies, and media and I didn't realize it. My family was Republican. Even though we were ""color blind"" racists, there is so much unconscious socialization and reinforcement that plants the seeds of racism. Donald Trump watered those seeds in my mind, and emboldened me to go full-on racist. I started using the n-word with Zoey in private. The memes I was sending were directly from /pol/ at this point.

Even though Zoey was a heavily tatooed, dyed hair kind of girl, I know she ended up voting for Trump back then. We travelled to her family. Her mom expressed how great her back deck job was and that her job was done by ""all nice white men"". Yeah, she had the same racist socialization as me. At the time, with my racism truly on my face (but still denying it, of course) I smiled and nodded when she said that. We drank and talked about who we were voting for. It was unanimously for Trump, Zoey included.

The election came and went. Zoey was born in England and we also cheered along Brexit. I felt good. Like we had won something. This went on and on until Zoey and I eventually broke up because I really was a shitty and emotionally abusive partner (would any /pol/ regular make a good partner?)

Well, I eventually turned to drugs to cope with the break up. I was _so_ anti-drug, even pot, that it was wild that I had gotten into them. But I had been drinking and partying, went back to a friend's place after, she smoked some weed, I decided, fuck it, how have I never smoked weed and I'm 25? Well, I got high and felt great. And so the addiction started.

Eventually, I shoot Zoey an email about a year after we broke up. ""I'm high lol. How you been?"" Ya know, the classic, they-forgot-to-block-me-on-email scenario. Well, she's cool with it. We hang out some more. Smoke weed, chill. All the while my mental health has been decaying like shit. My emotional abuse target was back and eventually I make no qualms starting to dump really heavy shit on her. Getting really reliant on her. She has some patience with me and even tries to talk me through things, but I just want sympathy, and that doesn't go well. She gets almost fed up. I go to therapy. The stresses of my life flow out and now I'm really fucking stressed. And I go to her. Bad call. She never wants to talk to me again. Fair enough.

But I stick with the therapy. I want to be better. I'm in a pretty miserable shitpile situation mentally at the time and sessions helped. I stick with it. And I'll never forget this moment. Up until now, this entire story, I've been your plain jane white dude. Well, my therapist mentioned her pregnancy at one point. The word. _Pregnant_. Without a thought, I grabbed my stomach and thought ""I'll never be pregnant"". For a woman who has been practicing for 15 years, I'm sure she's probably seen that miserable, grievous, shriveled-up look once or twice. A woman who had a miscarriage. An infertile woman. But probably never from a _man_. At the time, that wasn't enough for _me_ to realize and accept that I was trans, but she always seemed to hammer me on that. Sometimes she'd throw out the word ""hormones"" (which, yeah I knew what hormone replacement therapy was (switching your T for estrogen makes your body feminine like any cis woman's)). I saw it out of curiosity a _long_ time ago and was fascinated. Jealous, even. I wanted to be a girl when I was little. I always wanted to be a girl.

Over time, the therapy was really working and I thought strange things to myself like ""well, it wouldn't be so weird if I just... one day wore a dress to a session?"" I kept pushing it down though. I did not _want_ to be trans. Just wake up as a girl and nobody is none the wiser one day, that'd be great! Transitioning seemed like hell. Scary. But I knew someone who had done it. She was my roommate in college when she came out. We were still in touch. It wasn't until I hit a _deep_ deep depression and all these thoughts that I wanted to be a girl flooded back to me. Like for 2 weeks I was almost completely out of commission from my depression. I googled ""I don't want to be trans"" like 5 times in a day and finally, someone said something. ""Oh, honey, nobody wants to be trans"". That broke it for me. I thought ""okay, I'm trans... and the best thing for me to do... is transition.""

And that I did. And I learned more about transphobia. How it kept me in the closet. I learned a lot about many forms of bigotry. How they were all the same, and I came to empathize more with those less privileged and come to their aid. How to unlearn my racist past and work to recover from it. That was what sealed me away from Q and all the crap like that forever. Having feelings for other people. Honestly, before therapy, I didn't even really realize other people had feelings. Not even Zoey. I hadn't a shred of empathy in my body. And with all the depression and dysphoria I suffered, it made it easy to spew hate in a way to try to feel better about myself. I believe that better mental health is how we get out of this horribly backwards reality that we are in. And I'm going to become a therapist to do just that.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/kf7z10/i_am_a_trans_woman_who_voted_for_trump_in_2016_i/,/r/ReQovery/comments/kf7z10/i_am_a_trans_woman_who_voted_for_trump_in_2016_i/,0.83,2020-12-17 22:33:58
41794,41794,ReQovery,kfav5l,2,7,Nosleeptillbrklyn,Breaking out of Q world,"My story as a reqovering Q anon follower starts with the Snowden leaks.  I was an Obama voter in 2008 and again in 2012 but when the Snowden/NSA leaks were released I became super distrustful of the government and politicians.  I felt particularly betrayed by the Democratic Party which I thought of as the “good guys”.  I discovered Wikileaks and in 2016 when the Podesta emails leaked, I fell into the pizzagate rabbit hole which furthered my distrust of government and Democrats, despite being a liberal politically.  To this day, the podesta emails still confound me and I believe there is more to it, but this was just the beginning of my descent into madness and believing all sorts of crap like Q.

By 2016 I was had a much better job, was making a ton more money than I knew what to do with, and was partying and doing drugs more often.  As a result, my mind was more malleable and I got into Qanon through the remnants of pizzagate.  I started to believe everything was a sign of Trumps moves against the deep state and increasingly went against my own morality to sympathize with GOP talking points.  Over time though, nothing Q said came true and I became the butt of my friends jokes.  So many people had lost respect for me for my constant defense of the indefensible and abandonment of my liberal values, under the guise of “4d chess”.

I decided to take a break from all politics and social media since all of the q stuff was making me depressed and focus on myself - whether or not Q was true, I needed a mental health break.  I met a new girl and we started dating and she made me want to be better - and embarrassed when she easily debunked these half ass theories.  I eventually just stopped reading this BS but still follow some folks on social media who have moved onto new “anons” and “insiders” with similarly incredulous theories.  It’s insane how bad this slippery slope can be.

At the end of the day, Q hoodwinked me by taking advantage of my newfound distrust of government during formative years.  I’m not sure what the answer is to combat this disinformation, but I believe more transparency and trust between citizens and government is critical.

41797,41797,ReQovery,kh99o1,1,25,zekromthrowaway,Anyone else have anxiety attacks/possible triggers regarding conspiracy theories? Especially during the pandemic?,"CW: self harm, su//cide mention, direct mentions of specific fringe conspiracies 

 Hello. This is not my main account, so I may take some time responding to stuff. (Sorry for the formatting, too! I'm on mobile.)

For context: I have a severe anxiety disorder and possible/probable ADHD as well. 

I was very into conspiracy theories for a long time. It started as the generally harmless ""yeah, I guess that could be possible!"" stuff. Y'know. 9/11, bigfoot, etc. (I'm still somewhat into the whole cryptid thing, honestly.)

However, thanks to the YouTube algorithm, I eventually started diving deeper. And deeper. 
I also have a few family members who are even deeper into them than I am. So I would sometimes see videos that, looking back, leave me BAFFLED now. (One that stuck with me for it's sheer detachment from reality was that the sun was gone and replaced with a ""sun simulator"") 
I somehow believed, or at least almost believed, a ton of these. 
It got to the point where I was considering a suicide plan if the world ever came to an end or the ""crap hit the fan"". (Which looking back still kinda shocks me. I'm a Christian (not the nutty kind) and our whole thing is showing kindness and love, and having hope/trusting Jesus.) I never got to the Q stuff, thankfully. But I couldn't find a regular ex-conspiracy support group, so here I am.

This pandemic hasn't been helping any. Being in the middle of a panini has sent practically the entire world into conspiracy mode. 
Guess quarantine had a lot of folks watching YouTube a little too much. Suddenly, it's cropping up everywhere. From people I wouldn't even expect. These fringe conspiracies that previously sent me into episodes of anxiety and depression were now crawling into the mainstream (likely no thanks to Q) and coming back to haunt me. I've legitimately had to block a lot of political and conspiracy content from my social media because of the anxiety attacks and horrifying nightmares it was giving me. As I said, I have family members and friends who are also into conspiracies, but now even the slightly more harmless ones like aliens or flat earth set me off. One time my mom offhandedly mentioned a something like ""well if there's ever a worldwide government"" in a conversation that wasn't even about it, and I ended up having an attack so bad that i was getting lightheaded and starting to hyperventilate + my heart was racing. (My mom is thankfully usually super understanding of my anxiety disorder and took me to ihop to get my mind off of it)

TLDR: Ex-conspiracy theorist, generally managed to avoid conspiracies until the global panoramic hit.

I just wanted to know, am I alone here? Is there anyone else who also gets anxiety attacks related to conspiracy topics? :&lt;",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/kh99o1/anyone_else_have_anxiety_attackspossible_triggers/,/r/ReQovery/comments/kh99o1/anyone_else_have_anxiety_attackspossible_triggers/,1.0,2020-12-21 03:40:34

41802,41802,ReQovery,kpx3vn,1,21,ccx219,How I transitioned from Trumper to full on Socialist,"To give you some background, I am currently 20, come from a fairly conservative family in the midwest, and have always had an intrinsic interest in politics. Anyway, my story starts when I was about 16. I was fairly apolitical at this time, but I was just starting to get into things... right around the 2016 election. I went to a very left leaning highschool as well, and am thoroughly middle class. If we fast forward a few months after the election, thats when my story actually starts taking off. I had just gotten out of an incredibly abusive relationship with my first girlfriend, which included false claims of rape when I was still in fact a virgin, an issue that is still very important to me to this day. This really set the ball rolling on my downward spiral. Compound this misguided trauma with me being constantly surrounded by the edgy “anti-men” sect of feminists at my school, and this drove me deeper. I started frequenting various subreddits about “men’s rights” (which were very anti women) I was a big fan of dark humor so I was naturally drawn to the whole Anti-PC crowd as well. This all culminated in a point where I look back and realize that I was thoroughly alt-right. I championed people like Steven Crowder and Jordan Peterson. I genuinely thought that people were disenfranchising the white male and that all this “privilege” stuff was nonexistent, because I felt thrown aside, underrepresented, among many other negative emotions. I also for a while mostly lost what is now my defining trait: empathy. I saw poor people as leeches, POC’s as whiny, etc. I cringe now at just how hateful and unempathetic I was. Part of this I believe was I grew up in a white, healthily middle class suburb. I had never interacted much with POC’s and had never truly seen poverty. This was a big turning point for my eventual shift. I continued on this trend throughout the remainder of high school, I even looked at exclusively christian universities (as an atheist), because I was under the spell that most universities were just leftist indoctrination centers.

What really started the shift for me was summer 2019, I was participating in an internship in Las Vegas, and something beautiful happened, I came out to myself as bisexual. What kicked it off was meeting this fantastic man, we hit it off, and soon enough we were dating. I was in love, and through this act alone I realized how much internalized homophobia I had inside myself, and that started to chip at the narrative I had believed for over 2 years at this point. I then shifted towards a small sect of LGBT folx for trump (r/RightWingLGBT was my go to if its still around). I was pretty stagnant for a few months until I actually moved off to college. I was lucky in this regard, because even though I chose a christian school, I chose Portland Oregon to be my destination. At that school I met my now best friend, they’re a bisexual enby and fairly leftist, which further helped me to break out of this cult. Combine this with a fairly large LGBT “thing” happening in fall 2019, and me seeing the school’s abhorrent response to it, and I finally was able to call myself a Liberal. But my story doesn’t end there. Throughout 2020, with Covid and the right wing largely going off the hook with Q and all the anti mask and covid is fake bullshit I was pushed ever further left in order to escape it all. Another defining moment was not only moving to a much larger city, but also meeting another one of my EX’s and for the first time in my life, truly seeing the extent of which poverty effects people. Like I stated before I grew up surrounded by white, comfortably middle class people and never really met many people outside of my social rank. This was probably the most defining moment in my transition from center liberal to full on leftist. Over the past year I’ve dived into countless theories, essays, etc over the debate between socialism v capitalism. I’ve also become leaps and bounds more educated on racial issues plaguing America, and have witnessed first had the people trying to change it, being located in the epicenter of 2020’s racial justice movement. All this and more are why I am far happier, healthier, and more educated than I ever was before, and I owe so much of it to a few key people in my life, who without them I am not sure I would have found my way out of this cult. 

I’m sorry if this is incoherent, I tried to the best of my abilities to outline my transition, but I was largely just vomiting my experiences onto the screen.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/kpx3vn/how_i_transitioned_from_trumper_to_full_on/,/r/ReQovery/comments/kpx3vn/how_i_transitioned_from_trumper_to_full_on/,1.0,2021-01-04 00:40:33

41809,41809,ReQovery,ku2jv8,1,78,SnooChipmunks2810,To Ex-Qanon (from the Religious Community) Seeking Answers and Asking What To do Now,"I want to share specifically with ex-Qanon who come from the religious side of life, on what to do when your world and the expectations you had about spirituality have all just collapsed around you. Many followers of Jesus have gone through this experience.  There's a way out.  There's hope.    
I grew up deeply entrenched in Evangelical circles, and have known leaders from some of the biggest Qanon religious supporting churches and groups personally.  I have left the physical attendance of church but I have never left Jesus.  I am not ex-Qanon but I've been watching it with concern since 2017 and close members of my family have been sucked into the conspiracy theory hole, to the point of requiring mental institutional intervention.  But I want to offer encouragement to those who are wondering how this happened to them, who are sitting here, doubting yourself and everything.

This wasn't all on you.  Spiritual manipulation and spiritual abuse have been going on in the American church for years.  We who grew up inside of it were taught to revere our church leaders.  We were taught to honor them and believe them, for after all, isn't the pastor the one whom God speaks to?  For the benefit of our souls?  And any doubts we carry about God speaking through them can feel very much akin to sin because of how deeply embedded these ideas are regarding a ""holy priesthood"".  Especially if we've seen and experienced the truthful fruition of prophecies given or received.  

Faith in God is a beautiful thing.  And when you have held onto a Word of Prophecy for years, expecting and believing it with all your heart, it can be incredibly fulfilling when you see that thing come about.  The trick is when something beautiful like the gift of prophecy becomes entangled with things outside the sphere of Christian influence, like politics, a desire for influence or power and even magical thinking and nationalism.  I'm sorry they told you that stuff.  I won't say much more about them, except to denounce their lies.  These Qanon ""spiritual leaders"" who mixed the spiritual with grift were wrong.  They lied to you too.  I'm sorry they did that.  The Church began teaching Dominionism in the 90's. It was the idea that we were supposed to influence and maneuver ourselves into places of wealth, power and influence so that we could better be a witness for Christ.  

Unfortunately, this devolved into the idea that Anyone who possessed wealth, power and influence also possessed God's blessing.  Which is an odd idea to come up with when  Jesus had such consistently strong words of rebuke for the wealthy, the powerful and the influential in His own day.

Your spiritual leaders did not feed you well.  They didn't remind you, for instance, that Jesus told Peter to stop, when that disciple attempted to protect Jesus with a sword from being taken by the government.  Jesus was actually constantly reminding his disciples that His kingdom was NOT of this world.  That's a pretty clear dividing line, actually, between King-making and following Him.  He gives us two commandments and only two and they are the easiest and hardest things you will ever do: 1) Love God and 2) Love your neighbor.  It all rests on that.  

You were told by your spiritual leaders that you were supposed to influence.  So some of you gained huge followings and faithfully posted your qanon memes.  You were told you were supposed to gain wealth to ""help the kingdom"" and some of you gained immense wealth and donated it faithfully to the politicians you were told to give to.  You were told you were supposed to be a part of a political group that would awaken the world to a Kingdom that was both Godly and American.  Yet they forgot to remind you that Jesus said, ""My Kingdom is not of this world.""  It was never about taking over this world: just learning to love it.

They lied to you.  His truth is not in them.  And if you're sitting here, reading my words, and thinking, ""Yeah, but how  do I know what you're saying is truth?..."" then congratulations, my friend, you're on the path to becoming whole again.  There's an answer to that, and it isn't: ""Research for yourself.""  

The answer is the bedrock of truth that we who call ourselves after Christ come back to, whenever we get off the path.  The answer is  Jesus.  His truth.  Not ours.  Because our hearts aren't pure.  We can't always figure out what's true.  We're not actually supposed to trust ourselves and our ability to always discern what is true.  We try our best, but we're human and we mess up.  We all mess up.

I want to encourage you that Jesus died so He could love the messed up ones.  It's okay to experience anger towards these so-called ""spiritual leaders"".  It's okay to grieve about having believed them.  It's okay to admit they were spiritually abusing and manipulating us for their own gain.  If you can, find healthy outlets for sharing and releasing that anger (therapy, posting anonymously here, sharing with someone you can trust). It's even okay to deconstruct your faith.  I did.  For a long time, I needed to get far away from the spiritual people I grew up with and just hang with Jesus.  To remember the basics.  To figure out what truth is again.  I know they've told you that if you do that, you're back-sliding, but in all honesty, the word ""back-sliding"" isn't even in the Bible.  

Where do you go when everything you thought was true was just turned on its head and knowing this strips away your foundations and everything you thought you could hold onto? 

You go back to Jesus and His love.  

That's why it's the easiest thing.  Here's why it's the hardest:  Loving means first forgiving yourself.  Loving means listening to your neighbor.  Loving means giving without judgment.  It means letting go of our pride and recognizing we won't always be right.  Sometimes it means confessing where we were wrong.  But don't worry about any of that yet.  For right now, just know Jesus loves you.  He always has.  And even if everything else about your faith must be deconstructed, His love is the one thing you can always believe in.  

Let the rest go.  That is the foundation you need to start figuring everything else out.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/ku2jv8/to_exqanon_from_the_religious_community_seeking/,/r/ReQovery/comments/ku2jv8/to_exqanon_from_the_religious_community_seeking/,1.0,2021-01-09 23:51:30

I'm a french journalist (and I've been verified by the moderators) working atm on a video about Qanon and how people can be cheated by its ideas and theories and how they have been able to move on from it. 

Is there anybody here who would like to share its own story about the movement ? The goal is of course to spread the word of how tricky it is so that people can know what they're dealing with. 

The interview would be done through webcam and could be totally anounymous (I can easily modify your voice and blur your face totally so no one could recognize you).

I just read a post about what to say to those who got caught up in the spiritually aspect of Q and loved it, because I think the worst thing about Q Anon in my experience is how it preys on very devout Christian people, like my mom and dad. Here’s my story:

My dad has been following Pizzagate since it broke in 2016. He told me a lot about it but i never really worried about it until I got stuck in a conspiracy theory vortex (not quite Q, but definitely did a lot of reading about pizzagate and the “cabal,” which terrified me) when the quarantine started. I got myself out of it, through a lot of meditation and research but my parents are still sort of on the Q train. The thing that they’re really scared about though is the Cabal and the NWO, which my dad really believes is eventually going to persecute and kill Christians. I don’t know how to talk to him about it; he believes it so fiercely and is so afraid that sometimes I end up losing myself and having to recentar myself so that I don’t fall back down into the same hole, if that makes sense.

I was just wondering if there was anyone else who could sort of speak to this. I’m very glad to have found this sub. No one else I know is very well-versed in Q Anon, they all think it’s nothing but a bunch of racists, but in my experience it’s at least in part a group of religious people who are literally being presented with an apocalyptic scenario.

41833,41833,ReQovery,l1ryt2,1,2,Commie_EntSniper,My Message To QAnon's: It Gets Better,"I had a crisis of faith as a young adult. Everything I had been taught was ""The Truth"" and it's all I knew for my entire childhood and young adulthood. Then a teacher of my faith told me explicitly that everything Id been taught me was a lie. Not only that - there was a new and better Truth, right over here...

As I processed this, I remember feeling like I was falling forward in my chair, over and over. Sort of like vertigo, or maybe I was about to pass out. Maybe I blew a circuit.

Since then I've been a seeker, believing there are fragments of Truth everywhere, and I'm trying to pick up the pieces as I see them and make sense of what the Bigger Picture might be.

But that feeling of being lied to - of placing one's faith and future into trusted hands and finding out that you've been lied to... It's really hard. I know. But it gets better.

Consider that you're going to be going through a period of grief. Having experienced paradigm-shifting soul-twisting lies, going through [the 7 Stages of Grief](https://www.google.com/search?q=7+stages+of+grief&amp;oq=7+stages+of+grief) is just sort of how things go. So let yourself go through each of these and ""Trust the process"". Things will get better.

The fastest and best and hardest way is directly through it.

Also consider that you're going to come out of this a bit smarter, a bit more aware, a bit more discerning about, well, everything. You can't go down the Rabbit Hole and come back out with the same perspective about the world as when you went in. The Rabbit Hole is full of wonders and mystery and a lot of bullshit. I think one's quality of life is correlated with the ability to distinguish the wonder from the bullshit.

There is still definitely evil in the world. And a call for each of us to contribute to making the world a better place. And it won't be because of a hero who saves us. It'll be us saving ourselves.

Take it easy, QAnon. You've been on a wild ride.

41836,41836,ReQovery,l2ehyn,1,7,Starmark_115,'The Hill We Climb' Poem by Amanda Gorman (Inauguration Poem),"When day comes, we ask ourselves where can we find light in this never-ending shade?
The loss we carry, a sea we must wade.
We’ve braved the belly of the beast.
We’ve learned that quiet isn’t always peace,
and the norms and notions of what “just” is isn’t always justice.
And yet, the dawn is ours before we knew it.
Somehow we do it.
Somehow we’ve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn’t broken,
but simply unfinished.
We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.
And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine,
but that doesn’t mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect.
We are striving to forge our union with purpose.
To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters, and conditions of man.

And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us.
We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside.
We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another.
We seek harm to none and harmony for all.
Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true:
That even as we grieved, we grew.
That even as we hurt, we hoped.
That even as we tired, we tried.
That we’ll forever be tied together, victorious.
Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division.
Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree and no one shall make them afraid.
If we’re to live up to our own time, then victory won’t lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we’ve made.
That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb, if only we dare.
It’s because being American is more than a pride we inherit.
It’s the past we step into and how we repair it.

We’ve seen a force that would shatter our nation rather than share it.
Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy.
This effort very nearly succeeded.
But while democracy can be periodically delayed,
it can never be permanently defeated.
In this truth, in this faith, we trust,
for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us.
This is the era of just redemption.
We feared it at its inception.
We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour,
but within it, we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves.
So while once we asked, ‘How could we possibly prevail over catastrophe?’ now we assert, ‘How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?’

We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be:
A country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free.
We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation.
Our blunders become their burdens.
But one thing is certain:
If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change, our children’s birthright.

So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left.
With every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one.
We will rise from the golden hills of the west.
We will rise from the wind-swept north-east where our forefathers first realized revolution.
We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the midwestern states.
We will rise from the sun-baked south.
We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover.
In every known nook of our nation, in every corner called our country,
our people, diverse and beautiful, will emerge, battered and beautiful.
When day comes, we step out of the shade, aflame and unafraid.
The new dawn blooms as we free it.
For there is always light,
if only we’re brave enough to see it.
If only we’re brave enough to be it.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/l2ehyn/the_hill_we_climb_poem_by_amanda_gorman/,/r/ReQovery/comments/l2ehyn/the_hill_we_climb_poem_by_amanda_gorman/,1.0,2021-01-22 02:59:56

Hello! My name is Linda and I am currently enrolled in an AP Research course that revolves around finding gaps in topics of our choice and figuring out a way to bring attention to those gaps and potentially solve the issues with our own research. This year, I have decided to revolve my own research on Conspiracy theories specifically QAnon.

For my research, I am trying to figure out why people believe in the theory and what types of ideals have influenced them to engage with it. 

Here are some of the questions I would like to ask anyone who has ever been influenced by the theory or an ex-believer:

* When and where was the first time you heard about QAnon?
* What types of documents or posts have you encountered about QAnon that have influenced you or someone you know to believe that the theory is true?
* Lastly, has someone ever influenced you, or have you influenced anyone into believing the theory? If so, what types of ideals did you/they bring up to make them believe?
* What made you an ex-believer of the theory?

I would really appreciate it if your answers were specific as possible. Feel free to either post your answers here or email them to me at: salazarlinda743@yahoo.com

41844,41844,ReQovery,l3fia2,1,19,GallagherMaccini,The lie outlasts the liar,"I’m something of an accidental expert on QAnon. I was there in the very beginning to witness the disappearance of MegaAnon and the appearance of Q in October 2017. People hadn’t realized what QAnon really *was* yet, even as they still generally haven’t. [MegaAnon](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/795d6a/megaanon_postings_compiled_may_2017_present/), [FBI Anon](http://archive.is/gJYgy), [Senate Anon](https://archive.fo/eOLHb) were all disclosure texts directly preceding Q, all alleging various levels of corruption, and all generating hordes of beloved followers. Q co-opted themes and ideas from these predecessors. It was conspiracy fan fiction, and for those whose reality in 2017 was increasingly incomprehensible, it was an escapist digital campfire of scary story-telling that we flocked towards to be dazzled and fooled. Whether *some* of these anons were *some* of the time the real deal was unknowable, but the ambiguity of the unknown in a time of post-truth was tantalizing. And whither their true value, they were all well-executed kayfabes of reality, skillful Pavlovian reengineerings of psychic energy. But all of them ultimately disappeared. Q stopped posting on December 8, 2020. All told, it was a nearly four-year operation whose produced text – almost 5,000 posts – will be outlasted by its social and political effects for years. The historian Timothy Snyder [reminds](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/magazine/trump-coup.html):

&gt;The lie outlasts the liar. The idea that Germany lost the First World War in 1918 because of a Jewish “stab in the back” was 15 years old when Hitler came to power. 

___
Where will QAnon be in 2035? That is the most important aspect of this story. In the beginning Q’s claims were smaller than what they would become. I can’t say I was ever a true believer, so this letter has undoubtedly lesser impact than a more severe recovery story, but I did continue to follow out of curiosity about its source. And to find out if it was *all* bullshit or not. All I was interested in was whether or not thousands of sealed indictments were ready to be unsealed and expose the rampant corruption that most people, to certain degrees, darkly suspect of their governments. 
___
I had wanted to believe these original claims of corruption for a fairly straightforward reason: they provided an uncomplicated, uniform answer to solving the multivariate problem of evil. Oh, of course I *could* have remembered the world was more complicated than that… but I actually couldn’t see that at the time. My psychological equilibrium was compromised by a profound anxiety over Trump's election and its implications, and the monolithic scapegoat of a corrupted, corrupting and all-powerful world elite provided a welcomed alternative to the bleak reality that compromised my ability to critically analyze what I was considering. When your world breaks down, you consider everything again, because, having been fooled… what *do* you know? In such cases, we delude ourselves. Critical thinking collapses; cognitive delusions and confirmation biases are embraced when reality overwhelms. A mind under the influence of fear begins to “focus down."" It loses the capacity to hold higher levels of complexity and nuance. It feels under threat and must focus in order to act. Knowing for certain the difference between good and evil, and that you’re on the right side, instills confidence and the ability to act. It's stabilizing.
___
When you’re under duress you forget who benefits from a story like Q’s, and the fact that there are actors in the web’s wild west who are committed to full-time psychological warfare. Again, if there’s anything that ancient wisdom and modern science [agree](https://www.pdfdrive.com/why-buddhism-is-true-the-science-and-philosophy-of-meditation-and-enlightenment-e158065783.html) on, it’s that we delude ourselves willingly. Disinformation campaigns like QAnon are designed to take advantage of these biases in fraught societies and psychologies. They prey upon the epistemic and cognitive constitutions of those currently suffering through the largest mental health crisis in history. These psywar campaigns aim to weaponize the unstable and destabilize the rest. Notice how a bad trip – or paranoia – is always: “there’s a conspiracy against me, everything is connected *in a bad way*,” and a good trip – or manic high – is always: “the universe is conspiring in my favor, everything is connected *in a good way*.”
___
Q goes like this: 1) The mainstream media and governing institutions are captured by the Deep State and we have been subjected to their propagandistic misinformation for decades. 2) Thanks to Q we are slowly moving towards a Great Awakening when these secrets will be revealed in the form of a great unsealing of indictments and the injustices they hide will be redeemed. 3) The world is run by the Deep State, which is a cult of economic elites composed of all parties and festering at the tops of all hierarchies in all nations, and they all want punitive algorithmic justice programmed by a technocracy run by transhuman, godless liberals, and, finally, 4) Trump was recruited covertly by benevolent parts of a somehow uncorrupted U.S. military to disband this evil transnational cabal. Q might have been a part of the Trump Administration, might have even been Trump himself, but at the very least constituted an elite echelon of white hat military insiders. Elsewhere in the community it was implied Trump was working with benevolent extraterrestrials (or angels) alongside these military experts communicating as Q.

This ever-expanding plot, guided by Q’s synergistic encouragement of crowd-sourced corroborative evidence hunting constitutes a modern version of mythmaking. The oft-repeated phrase: “News unlocks,” meant that the truth of Q’s claims were to be verified by the very same news controlled by the Deep State. Q is an information cult, which, as much as it decries mainstream media, parasitizes it to justify Q’s truth-value as much as it seeks to undermine its host’s. The cognitive dissonance is baked into its structure. This becomes a self-perpetuating cycle of increasing plausibility, and the epistemic closure of its self-sealing logic compels Manichean allegiance in a total psychic surrender and a bewildered disillusionment with reality. To seek out evidence from such motivated reasoning and confirmation bias is to be an active participant in the undermining of your own cognitive foundations. It means leaving your previous reality behind at the cost of your intellectual integrity. It is a proactive self-delusion.

These “self-organizing collective intelligences” (SOCI), are a new kind of sociocultural phenomenon beginning to emerge in the niche created by the Internet. The Q SOCI is searching through everything in the realm of conspiracy that might be real and what might be true and slowly weaving them into an internally consistent, coherent and congruent fabric. New facts are constantly surfaced, some are hinted by Q drops… all of it is collectively processed by the Q community online. Models and hypotheses are proposed that try to make sense of the new information. The most compelling are shared through the distributed network of the SOCI where they are integrated, modified and brought into further consistency with the larger set of metamodels.

And yet the sealed indictments were never released. Hillary, G.W., Obama and others who Q claimed to be secretly locked up at Guantanamo Bay kept appearing in public -- seemingly disproving this theory over and over again -- and the Q community’s justifications for delays became stranger: the elites were in fact clones (including Joe Biden) or wearing tracking devices, or both. The Russia investigation was actually going to reveal not only Trump's innocence but the whole Satanic plot against him. When nothing like that happened, this hope was transferred to the Durham report. When this was released, and still the Great Awakening hadn't happened, that plot line disappeared from Q's messaging. A lot of loose ends never developed (""Trust Sessions,"" “Trust in your President,” “Trust the Plan,” etc.). The justifications for any discrepancies in the data were Deep State control and, anyway, there was always the old admonishment that “Disinformation is necessary.” What seemed relevant persisted in the Q community narrative, and the incomplete passes were forgotten until only the true believers remained to believe everything that was said.

Witnessing this phenomenon was like being mesmerized by a train crashing in slow motion. The sheer horrific imagination of such a story makes it compulsively addictive – which is exactly the point – even to a progressive liberal like me. (I rage against the corruption of the *Democratic* machine, lest we ever forget what happened to Bernie Sanders.) Q’s audience was fed and dined on this imagined, communally-crafted alternate reality. The Q drops come at Pavlovian intervals, always right on time, sometimes mercifully after two weeks when usually dropped daily. And the ones who needed to feel the most special were drawn to this material and hooked, needing, as they wanted, to be the only ones who knew what was *really* going on. One of the benefits of swallowing this narrative is putting yourself at the subversive and heroic center of your social network. Thusly inoculated from doubt, one’s siloed hubris makes it much less likely to recognize the historical context of Q’s disclosures, which were exquisitely – and in retrospect, obviously – a remixed expansion of the most enduring conspiracy of modern times: the [Protocols of the Elders of Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion) (an antisemitic Russian forgery from the early twentieth century) which pairs well with the Middle Ages folk tale about child-abducting Jews who mix the [blood of Christian children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel) into their matzah bread.

The wars of this century are currently being fought in the psychic and cyber spaces. I suspect this is one of the first campaigns of its kind. Nietzsche had prophesied something of this sort would happen in the aftermath of the breakdown of truth that followed the Protestant Revolution. After the guiding institutional source of truth had been dismantled in independence from the Catholic Church, many in the modern world just *wouldn’t believe anything* the same way anymore. Radical skepticism is born from radical lies. If QAnon isn’t a complete [LARP](https://medium.com/curiouserinstitute/a-game-designers-analysis-of-qanon-580972548be5), it is certainly a psyop/disinformation campaign designed (or co-opted) to destabilize targeted populations using information warfare. Proof of concept is exemplified in the New York Time’s sweeping 45-minute minidoc “[Operation Infektion](https://youtu.be/tR_6dibpDfo),” which traces Moscow’s decades-long campaign to trick Western citizens into using disinformation against themselves. Second-rate autocracies have been developing these programs for decades to displace the geopolitical ascendency of the United States from within, and, more broadly, to support continuous populist uprisings against the world’s reigning liberal democratic powers. This fact is *drastically* underestimated by Q’s followers, if they're aware of it at all.

Only time will tell.
The lie outlasts the liar. The idea that Germany lost the First World War in 1918 because of a Jewish “stab in the back” was 15 years old when Hitler came to power.

Where will QAnon be in 2035? That is the most important aspect of this story. In the beginning Q’s claims were smaller than what they would become. I can’t say I was ever a true believer, so this letter has undoubtedly lesser impact than a more severe recovery story, but I did continue to follow out of curiosity about its source. And to find out if it was all bullshit or not. All I was interested in was whether or not thousands of sealed indictments were ready to be unsealed and expose the rampant corruption that most people, to certain degrees, darkly suspect of their governments.

I had wanted to believe these original claims of corruption for a fairly straightforward reason: they provided an uncomplicated, uniform answer to solving the multivariate problem of evil. Oh, of course I could have remembered the world was more complicated than that… but I actually couldn’t see that at the time. My psychological equilibrium was compromised by a profound anxiety over Trump's election and its implications, and the monolithic scapegoat of a corrupted, corrupting and all-powerful world elite provided a welcomed alternative to the bleak reality that compromised my ability to critically analyze what I was considering. When your world breaks down, you consider everything again, because, having been fooled… what do you know? In such cases, we delude ourselves. Critical thinking collapses; cognitive delusions and confirmation biases are embraced when reality overwhelms. A mind under the influence of fear begins to “focus down."" It loses the capacity to hold higher levels of complexity and nuance. It feels under threat and must focus in order to act. Knowing for certain the difference between good and evil, and that you’re on the right side, instills confidence and the ability to act. It's stabilizing.

When you’re under duress you forget who benefits from a story like Q’s, and the fact that there are actors in the web’s wild west who are committed to full-time psychological warfare. Again, if there’s anything that ancient wisdom and modern science agree on, it’s that we delude ourselves willingly. Disinformation campaigns like QAnon are designed to take advantage of these biases in fraught societies and psychologies. They prey upon the epistemic and cognitive constitutions of those currently suffering through the largest mental health crisis in history. These psywar campaigns aim to weaponize the unstable and destabilize the rest. Notice how a bad trip – or paranoia – is always: “there’s a conspiracy against me, everything is connected in a bad way,” and a good trip – or manic high – is always: “the universe is conspiring in my favor, everything is connected in a good way.”

Q goes like this: 1) The mainstream media and governing institutions are captured by the Deep State and we have been subjected to their propagandistic misinformation for decades. 2) Thanks to Q we are slowly moving towards a Great Awakening when these secrets will be revealed in the form of a great unsealing of indictments and the injustices they hide will be redeemed. 3) The world is run by the Deep State, which is a cult of economic elites composed of all parties and festering at the tops of all hierarchies in all nations, and they all want punitive algorithmic justice programmed by a technocracy run by transhuman, godless liberals, and, finally, 4) Trump was recruited covertly by benevolent parts of a somehow uncorrupted U.S. military to disband this evil transnational cabal. Q might have been a part of the Trump Administration, might have even been Trump himself, but at the very least constituted an elite echelon of white hat military insiders. Elsewhere in the community it was implied Trump was working with benevolent extraterrestrials (or angels) alongside these military experts communicating as Q.

And from there the claims broadened quickly. The worldwide economic elites became Satanic, child-killing pedophiles who planned 9/11 and the murders of JFK and John John and everyone else. The narrative became suffused with right-wing evangelical hopes of Trump as a God-fearing Cyrus handpicked to rid the earth of these corrupt, secular elites in control of all parties and behind all major historical events. We’re all to be nanotechnologically tracked, mark-of-the-beast style, by vaccines.

Hello! My name is Linda and I am currently enrolled in an AP Research course that revolves around finding gaps in topics of our choice and figuring out a way to bring attention to those gaps and potentially solve the issues with our own research. This year, I have decided to revolve my own research on Conspiracy theories specifically QAnon.

For my research, I am trying to figure out why people believe in the theory and what types of ideals have influenced them to engage with it. 

Here are some of the questions I would like to ask anyone who has ever been influenced by the theory or an ex-believer:

* When and where was the first time you heard about QAnon?
* What types of documents or posts have you encountered about QAnon that have influenced you or someone you know to believe that the theory is true?
* What made you an ex-believer of the theory?
* Lastly, has someone ever influenced you, or have you influenced anyone into believing the theory? If so, what types of ideals did you/they bring up to make them believe?

I would really appreciate it if your answers were specific as possible. Feel free to either post your answers here or email them to me at salazarlinda743@yahoo.com

Thankfully there are so many ""drops"" that it makes analysis of idiolects more possible, although with thousands of cautioned considerations. I found an interesting article the other day that might have been posted here earlier about [Swiss ""text sleuths"" who have analyzed the language of Q drops to identify two different identities behind them](https://www.thelocal.ch/20210117/how-swiss-text-sleuths-have-unpicked-mystery-of-qanon-origins).

I'm not really sure what I believe anymore. Not that I'm having a crisis of identity, but I made a promise to myself that I'd be here on Jan 20th if I was wrong.

I was wrong.

I am a Q follower and a Trump Supporter. Joe Biden wasn't supposed to be Inaugurated. And yet here we are, with Biden as the 46th President of the United States. 

My first goalpost move was on Nov. 4th, when Trump wasn't reelected in a landslide. Next goalpost move was the Electoral College. After that, the Joint Session of Congress certification. And now today. I don't really know what I was expecting. But I was expecting SOMETHING. 

What I got was nothing. No ""declass"", no arrests, no martial law, no Insurrection Act, no come from behind last minute Hail Mary followed by an onside kick and an extra point. Nothing. 

Confusion would be the best way to describe my current mood. A little disappointment. Some embarrassment. Maybe even relief? I mean, if Q was bullshit, maybe our world isn't being run by Satanic Paedophiles, right? (I tried to stay away from that end of the pool... a little too deep for my tastes). 

Anyhow, this post is for three reasons. 

* One, my own personal commitment to not moving the goalposts any further. 
* Two, to let you all know that there are those of us out there who (for whatever reasons) believed in the Q movement, and are now taking a hard look at how our beliefs do not line up with current events. 
* And three, a dear friend of mine posted about me, in this subreddit. He is one of the few that I ""came out"" to,  and the only person who has stopped talking to me.

I don't blame him and I take full responsibility for my own beliefs and actions (which were limited to various Pro-Trump and Pro-Q forums, always anonymous, and never encouraging violence or hatred towards anyone). In case I decide to link this to him, I'll call him Energised Honour.

I hope that he will someday accept my sincere apology and we can laugh about this years from now as ""that time Milk_Ranch fell for Q.""

I've read some of your stories. It's absolutely terrible what ideological extremism (regardless of the ideology itself) can compel us to do to one another. My hope is that the ones you love will decide that their relationship with you (and reality) are more important than whatever it is that they think is coming. Our country is deeply divided. We need more people like me to admit our mistake, and more people like you (hopefully) to say ""yeah, that was kinda dumb, but let's move forward together.""

41859,41859,ReQovery,l6zcbh,1,105,ehkay27,ADVICE! How do I best confront my friend about her Q obsession?,"I'm not going to make the super long, and obligatory I'm on mobile spiel. Idk if the title is right but tbh I dont post much on here... I just dont know where to turn anymore. 

So about a year ago, my friend really got into the qanon conspiracies oh, and while it was kind of interesting for a while and we all kind of fell into it and we were just interested in learning about something new and finding it really fascinating to be honest that people felt like this, she's taking it so far while we have all kind of stopped talking about it. She is my best friend, she lives in the UK, and I am here in America. Just for some context. She has been ranting and raving about Trump and everything for over a year now, and while I think that's okay to a point because I do like Trump and I voted for the man I do not think that he is God or some Prophet that is going to save the world like in some movie. She doesn't fully understand how American politics work so when I try and correct her on certain things show either blow me off and sweep it under the rug or get mad. Today we're having an intervention. Just me and one other friend and we're going to have a talk with her about how this is affecting her and her life and everybody around her, but here I am afraid to lose my friend. I just need some guidance, I need some advice on how to reach her without losing her. I thought everything would be fine after the inauguration, she would move on and get over it and realize Q is fake, but now she's talking about March 4th and it's like God damn can you please just stop. If anybody, and I'm sure 90% of you have, has any advice on how to deal with this and how to approach this any and all advice is welcome.

Please be kind even though I voted for trump lol its all over with now so let's just move past that lol. 
Thank you all in advance.

My friend is a major qanon supporter and I need advice on how to de-program her without losing her as my friend.

41863,41863,ReQovery,l7colw,1,6,millwallmatters,The constant belitteling of the MSM from Qanon and Trump,"The mainstream media sure is not perfect, far off. The main thing that can be leveled at them is that they are biased.

But coming from someone who has experience in the field, what they are is people who work with facts. They gather facts. If you're a journalist, even on the tabloids, and you make up just one fact, you will be out on your ass in no time. It's just not tolerated. Each story is, or was, put up the editorial chain and each member has a vested interest in seeing that the story is true. The New York Times has a dedicated fact checking team for example. 

They have opinion pieces, always barely worth the bother. But their news stories, I would honestly say that 99% of the time, they are based on collected facts. And most, if not all, MSM outlets will *not* extrapolate from those said facts. They will just report them.

The rage-filled, rancid constant downplaying of the MSM by the Qanon folk is truly worrying. And trump too, constantly casting doubt in everyone's minds. Instead they encourage such brain-dead solutions as ""do your research"" which normally just means taking for fact what Dave on Whatsapp has said, or some grifter on youtube who is making a fortune from his 200k views a month. 

If you really want to do your research - read books. Good ones. Ones that have been reviewed by giants of intellectual life like the New Yorker, The Republic, The Guardian, The Atlantic.

\-

Let me preface this by saying that I want my mind changed. I’m only twenty-two years old, and the idea that over half of my life could be spent living in an Orwellian dystopia is honestly terrifying.

I’d also like to say that I’m not trying to offend anyone with my beliefs or opinions, I’m simply looking for answers. If you can, take everything in this post as a whole and not as individual points, as it’s not so much the individual points that are bothering me but the idea of the individual points being interconnected to form a grand plan.

With that said, I’m going to present as much information as I can in as coherent a way as possible. I’m not an “expert” on these things. I’m no David Icke, so you can be sure that I’m going to leave out certain bits of information that could be relevant to my argument, so I apologize in advance if my arguments are only half baked.

Let me give you an idea of where I’m coming from.

Growing up, my Mom was - and still is - extremely deep in the conspiracy theory world; everything from reptilians to the Earth being hollow. As far as she’s concerned, COVID-19 is just another stage of the rollout of a massive agenda that’s going to end in the entirety of humankind being hooked up to Artificial Intelligence.

My Dad, on the other hand, is on the other side of the spectrum. If he can’t find it on the mainstream news, it hasn’t happened and probably doesn’t exist. There are a couple of exceptions to that rule, but by and large, he goes off of what the media says, particularly CBC, The Guardian, and Al-Jazeera English. He is extremely logical, and if it can’t be logically explained and requires there to be massive assumptions made, he doesn’t buy it.

As for the rest of the family, they largely follow my Mom’s side of the story. One of my half-brothers in particular is very deep in conspiracy theories. He thinks Q-Anon is a crock of shite, but has very strong beliefs about COVID being a sham and part of a plan to dehumanize people. Same with 9/11, smartphone rollout, social media, etc. It doesn't help that he's incredibly intelligent, and is VERY capable of defending his viewpoints. I don't bother discussing these things with him anymore because it always ends with me feeling more stressed out.

I’ve been stuck in the middle of these differing opinions for my whole life. Generally, my parents get along, but there were times where their differences devolved into an endless back and forth that had my eight-year-old self hiding under the bed thinking that divorce was imminent.

I’ll start by listing reasons that I can think of for a global agenda NOT existing, and then will go over reasons for why I think an agenda COULD exist.

AGAINST:

1. INFIGHTING:

Looking at the world today and all of human history as a whole, the idea of a group of people from all over the world pulling the strings of global affairs is kind of absurd. People don’t get along, so the thought of something massive like a covert global takeover going to plan without the whole thing collapsing because of infighting is almost inconceivable.

2. WHISTLEBLOWERS:

If there is a plan to take over the world and brainwash the population, why hasn’t it been completely exposed? David Icke says that the people who do the rolling out of the agenda are too far down the chain of command for them to have any idea of what’s happening. He uses the analogy of a spider web: the spider at the center of the web is pulling the strings, while all the other parts of the web simply communicate with one another without knowing that the orders being issued are coming from the spider at the center. Again, I don’t see how SOMEBODY hasn’t found out about it yet and decided to blow the whistle.

3. EDWARD SNOWDEN:

Edward Snowden has said in the past that he hasn’t been able to find any evidence for conspiracies like chemtrails or UFO black sites existing, and if I understand him correctly, he had access to the databases of the CIA, the NSA, the FBI, and the military, and he didn’t find anything. Now he did say that these conspiracies may exist, but if they did they would have to be hidden insanely well. That could be the case, but I feel like it’s starting to get into Occam’s razor territory.

4. MOTIVE:

I don’t see there is a motive for global domination. After all, what is there to truly be gained? Money? Power? Control? None of those seem like realistic motivators to want to enslave the entirety of humanity. All three of those things can be achieved right now without global domination. Additionally, none of those things exist in a vacuum, so if a world government controls all the wealth and the movements of every single person on the planet, what’s the point anymore? That said, I’m well aware that a good chunk of the people in positions of power are actually psychopaths, and perhaps for someone who has no regard for human life those three things are a big enough motivator.

FOR:

1. “COINCIDENCE”

With what’s happening in the world right now, it’s difficult for me to feel like nothing is going on behind the scenes and that it’s all just a “coincidence.""

Surprisingly, many people aren’t aware of some of the things that go on behind closed doors and are only later made public.

Some of these things include the term “conspiracy theorist” being given negative connotations by the CIA as a means to counter and shut down discussion around the assassination of John F. Kennedy: [https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/03/16/did-the-cia-invent-the-term-conspiracy-theory/](https://www.snopes.com/news/2020/03/16/did-the-cia-invent-the-term-conspiracy-theory/)

Or Operation Northwoods: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\_Northwoods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods)

Or Operation Mockingbird: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\_Mockingbird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird)

Or Project MKUltra: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project\_MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra)

Or heck, even Steller Wind, which is almost textbook Orwellian: [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/11/snowden-files-declaration-nsa-spying-case-confirming-authenticity-draft-inspector](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/11/snowden-files-declaration-nsa-spying-case-confirming-authenticity-draft-inspector)

Needless to say, I feel like the fact that some of these programs were even considered, let alone put into action raises a lot of red flags around the world’s government truly having the people’s best interests at heart. If a government is capable of killing or spying on its citizens for political reasons, what’s stopping them from doing far worse?

Outside of government specifically, what about all of the allegations regarding pedophilia? The number of powerful people that received donations and endorsements from Jeffery Epstein is staggering, and for what exactly? Nobody seems to know. Then there are the allegations that are being directed at people like Andrew Derschowitz and Prince Andrew. Watching the Prince’s interview with the BBC regarding the accusations being made by Virginia Roberts against him, coupled with how difficult he is being in regards to providing information regarding the case, makes me doubtless that she’s telling the truth. The Prince’s behavior reminds me of myself when I was trying to avoid getting in trouble with my parents.

Additionally, if Prince Andrew is implicated in pedophilia, that could mean that the rest of the Royal Family could be involved in shady business as well. There is the whole conspiracy around Princess Diana's death after all. It doesn’t take much looking to see all the pedophile rings that are being uncovered, including some that are masquerading as charitable organizations: [https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/20/health/haiti-orphanages/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/20/health/haiti-orphanages/index.html)

Then there’s the number of people in Hollywood that are being ratted out as sexual predators; Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacy are the main ones that come to mind, but there are certainly others. Some of the statements made by Elijah Wood are pretty damning: [https://variety.com/2016/film/news/elijah-wood-pedophilia-hollywood-problem-1201781021/https://variety.com/2016/film/news/elijah-wood-pedophilia-hollywood-problem-](https://variety.com/2016/film/news/elijah-wood-pedophilia-hollywood-problem-1201781021/https:/variety.com/2016/film/news/elijah-wood-pedophilia-hollywood-problem-)

Then there are the blatant satanic undertones in the music industry. It’s not hard to find multiple music videos that are explicitly satanic. The one that immediately comes to mind is the video for “LA Devotee” by Panic at the Disco: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5dNcKTcnPA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5dNcKTcnPA)

Or the video for “Bon Appetit” by Katy Perry ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPI-mRFEIH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPI-mRFEIH0)) which smacks of the “Spirit Cooking” dinners hosted by Marina Abramovic. She says she isn’t a Satanist, but I prefer to look at a person’s actions and not their words, and her art tells a different story.

If she is a Satanist, that makes me question why on earth she is so well connected with the rich and famous.

As a side note, Abramovic also took part in an art exhibition that was organized by Microsoft: [https://newspunch.com/bill-gates-microsoft-cancel-marina-abramovic-campaign-after-people-flood-video-calling-her-out-satanist/](https://newspunch.com/bill-gates-microsoft-cancel-marina-abramovic-campaign-after-people-flood-video-calling-her-out-satanist/)

I feel that the claims that David Icke makes about there being a satanic cult pulling the strings from behind the scenes are only enforced by the content being produced by Hollywood and the music industry.

Moving onto the LGBTQ+ movement, I know I’m going to get crap for this but please try and be understanding. I have absolutely nothing against people who want to change their gender identity. I believe that a person has every right to do so and that they should be treated with general human decency and courtesy.

What I’m against is Sex Ed class being bumped down to kindergarten: [https://www.king5.com/article/news/politics/state-politics/washington-state-sexual-education-bill-passes-senate/281-a5d8b98e-1487-4be5-b2fc-f638b4511230](https://www.king5.com/article/news/politics/state-politics/washington-state-sexual-education-bill-passes-senate/281-a5d8b98e-1487-4be5-b2fc-f638b4511230)

Or little boys and girls being encouraged to wear clothing of the opposite sex: [https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8103957/boys-encouraged-explore-gender-dresses-australia-schools/](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/8103957/boys-encouraged-explore-gender-dresses-australia-schools/)

These are not issues that children should be getting exposed to. On average, a person’s brain doesn’t stop developing until they are age 25, so why on Earth do we think it’s a good idea to have children question their already extremely fragile self-identity? How can this NOT lead to kids becoming confused?

I’m going to say it again: I DO NOT THINK THAT A PERSON CHANGING THEIR SEXUAL IDENTITY IS SOMETHING THAT THEY SHOULD BE SHAMED AND OSTROCISED FOR. However, I do believe that the post-modernist relativism that is spreading around the world today like wildfire is only leading to destruction.

Camille Paglia was asked about her thoughts on the Transgender movement and she, a Gay woman herself, said that there is a pattern throughout history of transgender ‘mania’ being a precursor to societal collapse: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8BRdwgPChQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8BRdwgPChQ)

This is not, as I understand it, because transgenderism itself causes societal collapse, but because a lack of strong principles and belief in ultimate truth in favor of relativism leads to people losing their sense of morality and right and wrong, which in turn leads to anarchy, and finally to collapse.

I believe the emphasis placed on sex is less the CAUSE of the world's issues, and more just another SYMPTOM of larger issues.

Suffice to say, I believe it is easy to see how teaching kids to question their gender identity at an absurdly young age could be used as a control mechanism later in life. If someone doesn’t even know who they are as a person, how on Earth can they take an objective look at their circumstances?

Next on the list we’ve got the “Vaccine’s cause Autism” debate, which has become so toxic it’s almost impossible to have a reasonable discussion around it, which is why I hate to bring it up but it is relevant to COVID-19 so I feel like I have to.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently “debated” Andy Dershowitz on the safety of vaccines, though it was more of a discussion than a debate: [https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/kennedy-jr-warns-parents-about-danger-of-using-largely-untested-covid-vaccines-on-kids](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/kennedy-jr-warns-parents-about-danger-of-using-largely-untested-covid-vaccines-on-kids)

The video is quite long and there are a lot of points raised so I’m not going to get into them, but it seems that the majority of the points that RFKJ made are independently verifiable, such as vaccines not being tested against a true placebo, or how it is essentially impossible to sue a vaccine company for any form of injury caused to your child.

Then there’s the whole microchipping via vaccine thing which, while I haven’t seen any proof for, does seem possible as microchipping is becoming more and more commonplace, such as companies in Sweden having their employees microchipped as a sort of security pass or to replace credit cards: [https://nypost.com/2019/07/14/swedish-people-are-getting-chip-implants-to-replace-cash-credit-cards/](https://nypost.com/2019/07/14/swedish-people-are-getting-chip-implants-to-replace-cash-credit-cards/)

It’s easy to see how microchipping could be used as a control mechanism. A chip that can track your location, your mood, your health, and then beam that information back to a private server, regardless of where your phone is.

It’s even easier to see how creating an autism epidemic could be used to control the population.

That leads rather nicely into COVID-19.

Firstly, I’d like to point out the amount of blatant censorship that has been going on. Moments after the previously mentioned “debate” was posted on Facebook, it was taken down. The same applies to a group of front line doctors who recently went to the senate and were censored: [https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/censored-frontline-doctors-speak-out-we-want-to-help-people](https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/censored-frontline-doctors-speak-out-we-want-to-help-people)

It doesn’t make sense to me that the voices of credible people are silenced, simply because it goes against what the mainstream narrative is. Freedom of speech is a thing, isn’t it? It seems suspicious to me that the immediate response is not a reasoned argument, but censorship.

It also doesn’t make sense that Bill Gates, a college dropout, is given a larger platform than actual doctors who have gone through the schooling and know what they’re talking about. It seems like pure lunacy.

The thing that I think has me the most scared at the moment is this document by the company Onyx: [https://onyxinc.ca/covid-19.html](https://onyxinc.ca/covid-19.html)

It talks about an isolation facility that is being constructed to hold people who are suspected of having been exposed to COVID-19. It does say that where they will be transported depends on the results of an assessment, but the fact that it’s even being talked about is mind-boggling to me.

Yes, I believe COVID-19 exists, but I do not believe it is nearly as deadly as it has been made out to be, and I think that the actions that are being taken are over the top, to say the least.

The evidence for the efficacy of social distancing and masks also seems very spotty, so to make them mandatory in places like Calgary is shocking when they have the potential to do more harm to the people wearing them than good. While these do seem to be isolated incidents, people have died wearing masks, which I think calls their safety into question: [https://nypost.com/2020/04/24/driver-crashes-car-after-passing-out-from-wearing-n95-mask/](https://nypost.com/2020/04/24/driver-crashes-car-after-passing-out-from-wearing-n95-mask/)

[https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-two-chinese-boys-die-face-masks-gym-class-20200507-ruyinz7czjbqde3tprx647q3dm-story.html](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-two-chinese-boys-die-face-masks-gym-class-20200507-ruyinz7czjbqde3tprx647q3dm-story.html)

Then there’s the amount of hypocrisy and pure silliness. The British Columbian CDC recommended the use of “Glory Holes” as a means to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 while having sex: [https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/canada-cdc-suggests-glory-holes-for-safe-sex-during-coronavirus-news.114699.html](https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/canada-cdc-suggests-glory-holes-for-safe-sex-during-coronavirus-news.114699.html)

You’re telling me that a bunch of serious adults wrote that guideline?

Or what about the inconsistency in standards? It’s fine to go and protest the police, but not to protest lockdown measures: [https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/3/public-health-experts-support-george-floyd-protest/](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/jun/3/public-health-experts-support-george-floyd-protest/)

There’s also Agenda 21, which has almost become a buzzword thanks to the map created for it that shows human living space relegated to tiny little squares of land across the US, reminiscent of Suzanne Collins’ “The Hunger Games”: [https://americanpolicy.org/2017/10/04/agenda-21-agenda-2030-there-is-no-difference/](https://americanpolicy.org/2017/10/04/agenda-21-agenda-2030-there-is-no-difference/)

The last thing I’ll share is this video which my mother sent to me and prompted me to write this post as it kind of pushed me over the deep end: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=66XGOpMXCQE&amp;app=desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=66XGOpMXCQE&amp;app=desktop)

Finally, reason #2 for there being a global conspiracy:

WHISTLEBLOWERS:

While there hasn’t been a mainstream exposure of a plan to take over the world by a group of extremely powerful people, there are plenty of people who claim to have worked for a variety of powerful organizations that say that something is most definitely going on, and what they are saying is simply censored because it goes against the government agenda. Are they credible? Some of them seem to be, but that’s neither here nor there.

CLOSING

To close, I would like to say that I’m sick and tired of being stuck in the middle. I’m sick of being stuck in this conspiratorial soup that has done nothing but stress me out and make me feel miserable. I want my mind changed, but I also don’t want to stick my head in the sand. I want hard evidence against these things.

I’m not looking for someone to tear apart each of these points individually; I’m looking for someone to tear apart the whole idea. I don’t want to have a debate on the efficacy of vaccines, I want to know that vaccines aren’t part of a larger plan. I want to know that the way things are being handled right now is down to human stupidity and has nothing to do with a great big “spider” at the center of the web that’s pulling the strings. Thinking about this stuff has made me suicidal in the past and I don’t want that to happen again.

I’d also like to note that I don’t consider the sources for this information not being mainstream as an argument against the premise of there being a cult controlling the world, as the whole point of the argument is that the mainstream media is complicit in brainwashing the public.

I’m going to say it one last time: I’m not looking for an argument against each point, I’m looking for an argument as to why the idea of a secret society orchestrating all of these different things is illogical. Whether what I’ve said here turns out to be true or false doesn’t bother me half as much as the idea that they’re all intrinsically linked.

I do want to reiterate that I’m not trying to offend or attack anyone’s viewpoint. I’m simply looking for answers and some semblance of closure.

Thanks in advance, and stay safe out there.

41883,41883,ReQovery,lgahlx,1,54,Legal_Dragonfruit,The following youtubers led me down the Qanon rabbit hole (repost from qanoncasualties)," I   fell down the rabbit hole following the 2018 midterm elections and was   stuck there for a few months. The following names of youtubers are  what  led me down this rabbit hole. maybe you recognize a few of these yourself:

1. Jordan Sather
2. Liz Crokin
3. Praying Medic
4. X22report
5. Sgtreport
6. Sarah Westall
7. Dr Dave Janda (he was a Dentist)
8. Robert David Steele - said he used to be a CIA agent
9. Blessed to teach aka B2T
10. Lynette  Zang this economist who kept warning people to switch to gold because  the 'great reset' is coming with the economy (i sadly bought one piece  of silver and was even thinking about buying gold)
11. Deception bytes

There   were a few others that I recall watching that I can’t remember their   names. One was a guy and his wife living in Tennessee with a newborn   baby. He was actually the first one I watched at the time. He had a   basement farm growing crops and raising rabbits.

There   was a middle age to elderly Canadian woman who had a bunch of cats   living with her and one video showed some kind of notebook that   allegedly was ‘inside’ information on what the Watergate scandal was   really about. It was about spilling the beans on the ‘satanic cults.’   She called her videos qbites or something like that. I just remembered  who this was. The name of the channel is called Deception Bytes.

Another   middle aged woman who interviewed this retired cop that said he was   about to expose some higher up political figure of child sex   trafficking. She was blonde and also really plugged her merchandise in   her videos I remember. Just remembered her name its Sarah Westall.

There  was  this old man balding just sitting in front of a webcam relating  various  stories to us through breitbart and other sites and somehow  relating it  all to Q. I think he lived in Georgia and He really wanted  to see Hilary  arrested.

I also  remember a woman  who was a former news anchor i believe, and she got  access to a bunch  of megafile dumps of videos and pictures showing  famous actors and  politicians doing things the public never saw. Such  as the late John  McCain appearing with members of Isis and attempting  to sell the idea  that he was giving them secret info on citizens and  weapons. There was  another picture showing CNN anchor Anderson Cooper  sitting in a  remodeled cell at Gitmo ordering 'walnuts' -- which was a  code word for a  child's adrenal gland -- so that he can consume it and  somehow giving  them immortality. I know this \*\*\*\* sounds crazy but yeah  what sold it  for me was that she was in a perceived position of  authority so in my  flawed brain it made me believe her.

I   also watched this bogus propaganda piece that somehow managed to   convince me of its authenticity Ok i guess the link is causing problems   for the mods. the video is called ""Q - The Plan To Save The World""  which  im sure many former q posters here might be familiar with. It  tries  (and pretty effectively) to sum up the 20th century as a leftist   conspiracy designed to rule over the world and designates Trump as the   savior to lead us to freedom forever. I would even go so far as to call   it our generations ""Triumph of Will""-- that nazi propaganda film from   the 1930s. Look it up on bitchute if you are really curious. just  beware  of all the false claims it makes.

So   to those of you who have family members or friends who lost people to   this cult maybe you can look all these up and have them blocked on  their  computers or phones. looks like all of them have been purged from  youtube twitter and most social media thankfully, but your family or  friends may try to find them anyways so be aware of that.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/lgahlx/the_following_youtubers_led_me_down_the_qanon/,/r/ReQovery/comments/lgahlx/the_following_youtubers_led_me_down_the_qanon/,1.0,2021-02-09 18:56:12

How long this will take remains to be seen, without Covid it had shrunk in relevance in 2019 so I live it hope it can happen again soon. Covid was the perfect environment for it to grow and with the pastel Q wellness influencers  jumping on board it sprayed its shit all over the world . I am optimistic it’s relevance will again diminish without Trump and COVID settling down. The facts are none of there q crazy will ever come true so they need things to keep reinventing their altered reality, still enough around the election and covid to keep it moving but growing nope.

You don’t need anymore Q politicians or any chance Trump getting in again. His movement is very very motivated and already working in this area.

I've been lurking on the Q casualties subreddit for a while, but figured if I was going to make a post this is the best place for it. I've always thought of myself as conservative, voted straight republican all the way through 2020, listened to Rush Limbaugh, watched Fox News, etc. That being said, there were always things that the left championed (healthcare, support for the disenfranchised, etc.) that I found admirable but could never bring myself to cross the aisle. Then in 2018, I discovered Qanon, and I gradually became a cult member. I believed Trump could do no wrong, that his mistakes were chess moves, the whole bit. I bought emergency food, bought gold, bought guns, and listened to nonstop podcasts and YouTube videos. The constant failed predictions slowly started to erode my support, but I figured if anything was true, that Trump winning a 2nd term HAD to be. Trump's numerous Covid failures set the table, but when he lost, I started snapping out of it. The constant barrage of vote stealing accusations just really rubbed me the wrong way, and as all of them failed, I realized I had been duped. That's when I found the Q casualties subreddit and realized just how damaging the movement had been. Then, the big one. The Capitol Riot. I felt absolutely ashamed that I had ever been a part of that group, and when Trump made that video calling for riots to end, it was so disingenuous I couldn't believe I hadn't seen him as the grifter he was all along. It made me question EVERYTHING. I've since reconnected with some left-leaning friends that I had alienated during my Qanon phase, and realized that we had much more in common than I had believed. So much of what is happening on the right is downright greedy and selfish, not caring one bit about someone else's plight. I think Corona brought out the worst in Trump supporters. Anti-mask, anti-vax, calling the virus a hoax, was not who I wanted to be, but it was almost a requirement to be a conservative.
Anyway, I now find myself center-left politically, but I live in deep red Trump territory. I got the first round of the vaccine, but I literally can't tell anyone but my left leaning friends without getting a condescending look. Here's to 4 years of undoing the madness of the previous 4.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/mfdghb/the_election_and_capital_riot_smacked_me_so_hard/,/r/ReQovery/comments/mfdghb/the_election_and_capital_riot_smacked_me_so_hard/,1.0,2021-03-29 00:10:33

I'm wondering if the best course for q people who are very close to you, would be to simply talk in a compassionate, caring, patient way, and when referring to their obsession, call it just that - their obsession.  Don't say it in a judgemental way, but if eventually after weeks your interpersonal vernacular evolves to refer to it as ""your obsession"", then eventually ""your addiction"" instead of ""your hobby"" or ""those conspiracies"" then perhaps they will start to see them in the same way.

41924,41924,ReQovery,mgifyw,1,13,firstpageguy,Yes No Yes technique - When a Q person shares a theory,"I'm not a psychologist, just an idiot with an idea.

So we know that conspiratorial thinking is not about the theories themselves, it's just an unhealthy way to get emotional fulfillment through fantasy.

Therefore I think when a Q person is sharing a theory with you, the 3 things they are ""really"" saying are:

1. I am hurting, this fantasy helps me feel better
2. Will you believe it, or at least think it's interesting, thus affirming my fantasy?
3. Will you still support me, even though you don't support my fantasy?

As caring people, I think our answer to these 3 questions should always be ***yes, no, yes.***

When you react with frustration, anger, boredom, disinterest you are answering: *fine, no, no*

When you react with careful listening, and interest in the theory you are answering: *yes, yes, yes*

When you listen patiently, even asking questions (but not affirming!), making time for them. Being careful not to respond positively to the theory - but the person with a positive emotional note like ""i love you"", ""i will always be here for you"" you are saying ***yes, no, yes.***

It's kind of like a fine line to walk, might take some practice to not do it in a condescending or patronizing way.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/mgifyw/yes_no_yes_technique_when_a_q_person_shares_a/,/r/ReQovery/comments/mgifyw/yes_no_yes_technique_when_a_q_person_shares_a/,1.0,2021-03-30 15:22:35

Hello! I am looking for people that followed or studied Q-Anon. I am reaching out to see if anyone would be willing to allow me to do a brief phone interview with you on this subject. I am a senior in college. I will graduate with a double major, political science (emphasis in rhetoric and public influence), communications and a minor in history.

See below for my statement of intent. I would sincerely appreciate if a few people could give me 20 minutes or so.

Thank you in advance for your consideration.

**Statement of Intent:** Today the media is more distorting than truthful – at least about certain Issues. The media and the public in general are increasingly critical of followers and believers in Q. The name given to the followers by mainstream media are Q’ANON followers. Today they are painted as conspiracy theorists, cultists, and just plain crazy. This is where my paper comes in. I want to better understand both the believers and nonbelievers of Q. I will approach the topic as an unbiased third party. I will conduct a series of interviews with an equal number of believers and nonbelievers. I will ask them questions about the rhetoric of Q and their beliefs. I will then analyze the interviews and look for keywords or phrases that are consistent across multiple individuals. I will analyze the language under different rhetorical lenses to determine if the Rhetoric of Q’ANON can be understood using a certain rhetorical lens. Lastly, I will attempt to determine if there is something about the rhetoric that elicits the reactions that it does from both sides, believers, and nonbelievers. My goal for this paper is to create something that facilitates an open conversation between the two sides of a contentious topic as well as produce an unbiased rhetorical analysis of a movement and following that is growing in recognition. All interviewees will remain anonymous and their answers will be handled with the utmost respect and discretion.

It seems after our asset's mandate was stolen from him that the Great Awakening may not be coming.

I understand what you're feeling. That's why you're here.

And this is exactly Q's plan.

The Deep State thinks he's gone. They think YOU are gone. Far from it. The pieces are falling in place. The guard is down,  because they think they are in control.

Then, we strike.

We have many children to save. Do not give up on them. Trust the plan, stay tuned, and enjoy the comeback.

Hi everyone, 

My name is Laura and I work with the Organization for the Prevention of Violence. We created a survey  (link at top of post) to hear about the experiences and service needs of those involved in QAnon. We hope the results of this survey can be used to develop effective services for individuals and families who have been negatively impacted by QAnon. The survey is completely anonymous and can be completed by folks who have personally been involved with QAnon or folks who know someone who is/was involved. We sincerely appreciate all responses! 

Also if anyone is looking for supports for themselves or others, there is contact information at the beginning of the survey. Alternatively, you can reach out in this thread or via direct message on Reddit to me.

Q is different. It's about having someone on higher ranks that supposedly cares about the common man and has the means to ""fight back"" against evil.

Then Q people cling to it as hard as they can as one last source of hope before falling to despair.

It's quite sad, when you come to think about it.

41963,41963,ReQovery,nftkjv,1,22,SillyWhabbit,I just heard from my Q.,"I want to cry, because I am confused. It's the first time he's reached out to me since around July of 2020.

His mother, was my best friend for 25 of the 50 years I had been on Earth at the time of her stroke. Losing her was like losing my lungs, arms and sanity.

Her stroke was Christmas Day 2014 and I grabbed her son that was still living in my state and we went and joined his siblings in Texas. We sat with her for two weeks and watched her slowly go. It was traumatic for all of us and my Q was left angry. He hasn't dealt with any of it.

When he started posting really racist shit on FB, I stopped following, but didn't block him, because I'm Auntie, what if he needs me?!?! Then one day he showed up in a thread his sister and I were talking on. She had made a post about liking women. Her brother showed up and started throwing slurs. She wouldn't say anything to him and I could tell she was hurt, so I went off on him. I tried talking to him later, he said he wanted to learn and understand why the things he posted put his half brother ( part Puerto Rican by a different father) more at risk, but he would just dig his heels in.

I had to walk away, because all I could do was cry, and I didn't want to tell him how upset his mother would be at him. At 23, she still would have smacked him.

I rarely log into FB anymore. Really I just keep it for the kids, but I just had to send something to myself off my laptop and messenger works best to get something to my phone. There was a message from him on my timeline. It read: "" I miss our long/In depth talks and how you always knew what to say. Not what I wanted to hear but what I needed to hear. How I could get an outside perspective of the situation at hand. I miss my auntie! I'm sorry im an asshole and we see some things differently. Hopefully after this pandemic blows over we can enjoy each other company again.  I love you Auntie!! ""

I replied with: "" I've never stopped loving you. I had to disengage so I didn't say anything I would regret or that would permanently damage us, because some of the things you say, cut deep.

I also don't want to channel a version of your most angry mother at you. Even though I know some of how she would feel and what she would say, I am very clear, I am not her.

My phone still works, I just gave up trying to call you, because you don't often pick up and your voicemail is always full.

I'll always love you ####, but some of those disagreements left me feeling like I was failing your mom, so I had to just love you from afar for a while.""

I don't know if I said the right thing, or if I can even trust the little bit of the crack I see in him reaching out.

I don't know how to feel.

At one point I had to avoid those conversations because of how much they interfered with my view of reality. I still don't know what's true and what's not. 

The hardest part about these conspiracy theories is they have all questions or possible rebuttals already covered. For example, my dad could say that the vaccine is a government and Bill Gates conspiracy for population control, but if I bring up a source directly refuting that, he will only say that the media is in on it too which is why they're in support of it. I've realized that once you start to go down those rabbit holes, it's very hard to come back to the surface. If you believe the media, CDC, and WHO are lying about the vaccine in the name of conspiracy and power and control, how can your mind be changed? 

Even though I am an adult and should be making my own conclusions about the world, it is extremely hard for me to know which side is the ""right"" one. My parents draw a lot of their conspiracies from the Bible as well. I was raised Christian, but am currently agnostic, but that Bible stuff still bugs me from time to time. I wonder if it could be true after all, if everything they say and believe could be true, and I'm on the wrong side of history here. I'm scared to have the wrong answer. I'd much rather live with ""I don't know"" and be on with my life, but in this world it seems you have to pick a side eventually. 

It's like, when I've grown up believing that there is this huge, dark side to the government and the media, how can I trust that what they say is true? On the other hand, when nearly all of the general public condemns these conspiracy theories and looks at people like my parents like they're crazy, how can I rightfully believe my parents? But then, what if those people are just brainwashed by the media? 

I can go down these confusing spirals all day and still not know what to believe. I've tried doing my own research and it only gets me so far, since of course, any news outlet or even research article that is against what my parents believe is only in on the conspiracy, right? 

I just don't know what to believe. I don't want the conspiracy theories to be true, but I also don't want to believe that my parents are crazy like society says they are. I just want to live peacefully and trust in what I believe, which at the moment, is nothing.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/nl7qwx/raised_on_conspiracy_theories_facing_a_reality/,/r/ReQovery/comments/nl7qwx/raised_on_conspiracy_theories_facing_a_reality/,1.0,2021-05-26 03:55:04

The last 2 weeks I found myself devouring all information I could find down the Q rabbit hole, including flat earth. I found that I just couldn't go about life as usual if all of this was true: global satanic baby torturing adrenochrome cult, depopulation covid vax, UN/Nasa flat earth secret.

I mean, obviously if those are all true we have a major problem on earth and not going about your day job is clearly not a priority, right?

Well, yesterday I finally felt like I had enough gut level feeling and youtube evidence that I actually resigned my amazing job.

Then yesterday afternoon I finally realized that the earth definitely has to be round, I'm so embarrassed I won't even go into what finally did it for me.

Then all day and night I was like, shit - researching to make sure I was wrong.

(I deleted my original post on /Qult_Headquarters because this seems like the right, more supportive forum. This is not a troll)

41978,41978,ReQovery,nz332t,6,10,The-Drama-Lama,[Good Faith Q Recovery] Can we inject neoliberal memes into the QAnon universe of open-ended mystical research?,"To make sense of QAnon, we have to imagine a revolutionary cafe in France where thinkers share research with a mystical bent. QAnon still has to grassroots bootstrap its own universe of mystical ideas, and we could play a role.

You have to imagine an open floor to teach interesting mystical ideas in a traditional French Secret Society.

Let me explain a French, German, or British secret society.

The top priests of every religion use a visionary sacrament. That sacrament is thought of as access to the Source, as much as Jesus said Father. The German Illuminati were a Secret Society who used the visionary sacrament to say profound things about the Bible, because the sacrament was access to the living god who made it come alive.

The Germans get that the Source is the long lost key to the scriptures. The sacrament is Q. If QAnon is a “secret society” type of conspiracy, the conspiracies are interesting for being infused with the Holy Spirit. If QAnon are in any sense real-deal Neo-Nazis, then it is the existence of the Biblical German Illuminati who sanctioned ""Mein Kampf"" as the known real issue.

What does this mean for today’s Parler conspirators? The radicalized right is supposed to be the same issue as the bleeding heart, “Stairway to Heaven” left. We need to insert some of our own ”Stairway to Heaven” ideas in their meme-pool.

Can we inject the Deep State Messiah realsneaky.com into their circulating ideas?

In “Stairway to Heaven” the Dear Lady we all know personifies ayahuasca, an initiatory, knowing path. On her path, she turns glitter to gold. Have you seen the miracle of glitter to gold?‬ The Christians claim that you need the ""ears to hear."" Let me clean out your ears with this Q-Tip.

‪Her golden touch sublimates‬

‪1)Foo Fighters - ""Everlong‬""

‪2)Oasis - ""Wonderwall‬""

‪3)https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kwCY4BHWK9v7WaEOW5xRVDGTsmz5q9YA8cvLa96C7s0/edit‬

‪4)Tool - ""Pneuma‬""

‪That is “Wonderwall” before your eyes!‬ It is all divine medicine. The first of her wonders is the soft charm around your eyes.

5)Collective Soul - Shine

6)Bush - Comedown

7)History - Battle Hymn of the Republic

Those seven steps to the ""Stairway to Heaven"" are arguably the ""golden ladder reaching down / when the man comes around"" in ""The Man Comes Around"" by Johnny Cash. The lyric ""the whirlwind is in the thorn trees"" is also Tool's ""7empest."" The Foo Fighters' song ""All My Life"" precedes ""The Pot"" of gold over the rainbow, but the golden crown is in The Killers' song ""The Man.""",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/nz332t/good_faith_q_recovery_can_we_inject_neoliberal/,/r/ReQovery/comments/nz332t/good_faith_q_recovery_can_we_inject_neoliberal/,0.6,2021-06-13 18:51:03

My name is Nikki, a Dutch Political Science and International Relations master student. For my master thesis, I am looking into the transnational movement of QAnon. As a lot of the theories seem to be based on American events, I am trying to find out **why** it has gained a following in the Netherlands. 

I am looking for answers to the following questions:

**Why did you, or someone you know, choose to join the QAnon movement?**

&amp;#x200B;

* Which personal motivations did you/they have?  
 
* Where there events in your/their lives that led you/them to this decision?  
 
* Which personal values do you/they satisfy with joining QAnon?  
 
* What does their membership mean to you/them them?  
 
* In what way has it changed your/their life?  
 

Your information can be of high value in the research on this community. If you feel like you can answer one of these questions and want to participate, please let me know by commenting on this post or by sending me a message. 

Participation is completely anonymous as I will remove usernames and profile pictures. Before handing in my thesis, all participants are able to read the final draft if desired and all statements are allowed to be retracted at all times. 

I hope to hear from you.

41981,41981,ReQovery,nzqafe,45,4,RP_Anthropologist,I'm a Master student and I am here to ask the community a few questions. Your answers will contribute to the research on Qanon and the spread of online misinformation.,"Dear ReQovery,

My name is Michiel and I come from the Netherlands. I do a Master in Culture Studies and I am writing my thesis on the spread of misinformation in regards to Qanon. I am deeply concerned and come with a request for the people who have fallen victim to Qanon. If you believed in the Qanon conspiracy, but got out, I am very interested in hearing your story for my research. I am aware that there is a wide spectrum of buying into Qanon's ideas, but ever identifying as such is enough for the research.

The research on this topic is very limited due to Qanon being a very new conspiracy group. This is why I believe my research could be relevant in coming up with solutions for this recent phenomena. I have a small questionnaire with three open, and one closed question, some of which you possibly cannot answer. Leaving a question open is therefore totally fine. Any person partaking in this research will be handed a consent form with contact information about my university and a more thorough clarification. So please send me a comment or DM if you're willing to participate.

Your usernames and profile pictures will be made anonymous and this thread will be removed in two months from now. Anyone that is willing to participate has a right to see my final draft - a DM with a request will suffice. The questionnaire consists of four main questions in bold, and a few cursive sub-questions to guide you. You can choose to freely answer the main question, or you can use the sub-questions to help you. This is completely up to you.

The questionnaire:

1. **Could you explain how you bought into Qanon?**  
*What content creators influenced you in going down the rabbit hole? What was a key event that drew you into the group? Did you, at the time, understand how the information you find on the internet is personalised through algorithms?*
2. **Could you explain what kept you inside of Qanon?**  
*What does the community do to keep you from engaging with other information? How do members or creators make you feel like you are part of a close group? Are the members kind to each other, or hostile and if so: how does this show?*
3. **Could you explain how you got out of Qanon?**  
*What was a key event that made you doubt of Qanon's validity? How did you get in touch with conflicting information? Did you need an outside intervention for this?*
4. **Are you open for an anonymous conversation through chat or discord about your experiences?**

Anyone who takes the time to answer these questions will help us take little steps in research regarding this topic. Even though I am a Master student, I plan on hopefully doing a PHD on this topic and take the research I do on this with me. Your help is therefore important and greatly appreciated. Personal objections to releasing information will be adhered to and, as disclosed in my opening statement, a consent form with contact information and my university will be handed out to anyone who shows an interest in participating.

Thank you and kind regards,

I did receive verification from the moderator, so hopefully this is ok! I'm a freelancer working on an article for a national magazine about the difficulties former conspiracy theorists encounter when trying to seek help. This forum is so lovely, but generally, resources seem limited and there's often a lot of judgement. I'm hoping to raise awareness around the need for better access to services, trained therapists, etc.   


In my experience as a journalist, the way to truly help people is to hear from someone who's been where they are. So for my piece, I'm hoping to speak to a woman who used to believe in QAnon and who has since gone through therapy (or sought some type of treatment) and could share more info about her experience with me. I'm happy to make the interview anonymous.

42009,42009,ReQovery,okbwm3,1,16,EasilyAnnoyed,"My experience dealing with a conspiracy-laden blog that I followed religiously for years, and how I became re-acquainted with society.","Ok, so, I want to state upfront that I have never been a QAnon believer. I've visited a couple QAnon-focused sites just to see what it was all about, but that's where it stopped.

Back in 2009 or so, the world was still slammed with the fallout of the real estate crisis. Jobs were hard to come by, and working conditions were poor. Me, being fresh out of college and looking for ways to ensure retirement with a massive headwind in front of me, looked for guidance/advice. I started frequenting finance blogs/forums. That's when I stumbled across Zerohedge.com.

To be clear, Zerohedge is a site that gives both financial analysis and worldview perspectives. At the time, I thought the financial analyses were *fascinating*. I was willing to ignore the political articles/comments, which ranged from distasteful to abhorrent. Little did I know, the site was parroting Russian propaganda:

https://newrepublic.com/article/156788/zero-hedge-russian-trojan-horse

I bought the site's economic narrative hook, line, and sinker. The economy was on the verge of collapse. The dollar would soon become worthless. The only way to protect your wealth is to invest in precious metals (despite that, unlike stocks, do not provide any RoI!). I shared articles with family and pleaded with them to understand the danger that we all faced. I bought freeze-dried food to prepare for the food shortages that would inevitably happen. I even bought a gun to protect myself. I hate guns. I never fired the damn thing. I didn't even buy ammo for it. But I still owned it. I became a prepper.

I was working at a job that I hated (and the people there started hating me too) that paid well below industry standards. But thanks to the unreasonable demands of the company, I expected to never be qualified enough to get another job in the industry again. I was miserable and trapped. The doom &amp; gloom blogs were one of the few sources of pleasure I had. The mystique of knowing something as significant as imminent collapse (while all of the other ""sheep"" blithely go about their days) was infatuating.

But hindsight is 20/20. As the years passed, I became less enamored with the ""The economy is collapsing!"" and ""Gold will soar!"" narratives. Zerohedge posted fewer economic analyses and more propaganda. It was all coming apart. I soon stopped frequenting the economic sites and blogs altogether.

As I distanced myself from those disinformation sources, my worldview began to change. I became more liberal. I spent more time with my family, who are *hardcore* liberal. I didn't even notice my perspective as it changed, as it was so gradual.

After losing hateful my job of 5 years, I spent a day learning how to write the best damn résumé I possibly could. The following day I constructed one and posted it on LinkedIn. In less than a week, I would have another job lined up without having to file a single job application. That shitty job may have been awful, but all of its tumult gave me great industry experience.

My new job's contract only ended up lasting a few months. However, it gave a newfound sense of self-worth. I decided to move cross-country to California. I sold my gun, gave the freeze-dried food to a friend in need, and drove cross-country in hopes of a better life. I almost ran out of money in pursuit of a job, but I managed to land one. I now make 3x the amount of money than I did at the job I hated working for. My new job shows respect for its employees and isn't on the verge of collapse. It is total 180° from where I was five years prior.

This brings us to present day. Alt-right proponents scare the shit out of me. And yet, I know that not that terribly long ago, I may have become one of them. I spent some time reflecting on how I severed myself from that world, and here's what I came up with:

* The propaganda was demonstrably proven false

* I gave up the media that spread propaganda

* My life improved from one that felt helpless and uncontrollable to one of success and fulfillment

Sadly, I don't know if I can provide a single silver-bullet solution to QAnon. If you know someone that believes it, take the time to *listen to them*. Remember that they believe the propaganda 100%. It's very possible they're looking for an escape from their daily lives, and they're following QAnon because it's ""sexy"". Do your best to reacquaint them with regular society. Take some time away from Facebook by taking a trip to Yellowstone. Something like that.

I am a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

I am writing a dissertation about beliefs in conspiracy theories and am looking for participants to complete my survey. Completion will take about 25 minutes and everything is completely anonymous. A consent form is included on the first page and all participants are informed of their rights, information of who to contact if need be, and of the opportunities available to withdraw from the study. I'm looking for participants 18+. People that believe in conspiracies, do not believe but know someone who does, or that do not believe and do not know anyone that does are all equally desired for inclusion in my research. I am sharing to this page because so many of you have had direct experience with QAnon and potentially other conspiratorial groups and your insights would be extremely valuable to my research. As a social science researcher, my objective is to write reports and make findings that benefit society.

Anyone 18+ is encouraged to participate. Responses from individuals that do not believe in any conspiracies are just as valued as responses from those that believe in many. Once opened, the survey must be completed within 24 hours.

I am part of another group which people share stories of loved ones lost to Q, and this is a repeated trend - families are torn apart and the Q-follower prefers to be away than find a way to still be in each others lives. Children are cut off, couples divorce… it’s shocking and heartbreaking. 

So, I would be interested to understand why some people who have lived this and come back did so. Why did your beliefs make you feel you had to choose politics over family? What made you come back to them? How did that go? 

I’m selfishly trying to understand my own mother and although I don’t know how to trust her again, I would love to share this amazing time with my young children with her… but it’s so hard to see that path. There is a lot of water under the bridge…



Note; 
I know that not all Q believers go so far as to cut off family. This is just my experience and a trend I have read in many other stories. 

I also want to say that it’s amazing that those of you who came back from this have done so! I can’t imagine the difficulty in deprograming yourself and taking on a different world view.

I’m only 19 years old and have lost any sense of hope for the future because I believed that the world was going to end one way or another any second now. It is so scary to sit here and think about how much time I have lost reading into stuff that was literally distorting my perception of reality and not even knowing it.   

I’d just appreciate some reassurance that it’s going to be okay basically. I’m scared that I’ll read something that’ll pull me back in so any advice on how to ground myself back to reality would mean a lot, thank you for reading this far :,)",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/ooshy8/rabbit_holes/,/r/ReQovery/comments/ooshy8/rabbit_holes/,1.0,2021-07-21 15:42:46

42017,42017,ReQovery,or36xh,1,244,UsernameAnalyst,Have I been radicalized?,"Hello, r/ReQovery. I'm coming to this subreddit to ask a few questions, and maybe receive some help. I feel as if I've been goofing around in some nasty corners of the internet, and I think I might have been radicalized.

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, I know Donald Trump isn't going to save anyone, like the Qanon followers believe. He's a coward. Yes, I do somewhat feel as if the government is ridden with pedophiles and corruption from both the Republican and Democrat parties, but there's no way Donald Trump is going to ""have his loyalists on the inside expose them"" or whatever they believe. I don't even know what else these Qanon followers believe, but I'm pretty sure they believe that ""the day of reckoning will come"" or something and the pedophiles in the government will be locked up when Trump pulls off a 4D chess move or something. Is that right? Correct me if I'm wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, I do have a few questions based on things I have been told. I wouldn't call it propaganda, because the way I see it, the voices I was listening to have no institutional power, so it wouldn't be propaganda. Propaganda must be repeated in order to be effective, right? After all, the mainstream media corporations (CNN, Fox News, NBC, etc.) would probably be about 97% of what Americans consume on TV, and according to those people, they're working together and skewed towards a narrative. Not to mention many people say several voices of ""far-right conservatism"" are just grifters playing on peoples' insecurities and hate. Nick Fuentes, Ben Shapiro, Sargon, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

By most definitions of propaganda, I think it's not propaganda that was swaying me, but propaganda isn't the only thing that can convince a person of certain ideas. If a person wants to believe something, or if they're looking for answers to difficult, maybe unanswerable questions and someone comes to them with a target and a satisfying explanation, I think they can be persuaded of anything, no matter how outlandish. That's what radicalization is, right?

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, here are a few of the things they had me believe. Don't know if it's Qanon per se, but if you guys would call it radicalization, then let me know, and maybe help provide resources on de-radicalization.

* Both the US Democrat and Republican parties pretend to fight on camera, but behind the scenes drink together and laugh at we the people
* Both said parties want to keep the American people fighting each other, and not the government
* The US government harbors and loves pedophiles like Jeffrey Epstein (who very well may be just the beginning)
* The rest of the 1% are in on this pedophilia
* The 1% collaborate to push an evil agenda and undermine the American people
* Both liberal and conservative televised news want to have Americans believe that other Americans are the real enemy, and not the government
* And a few other things I won't get too specific on

&amp;#x200B;

Any comments would be appreciated. Have I been radicalized? If so, some tips on de-radicalization, as well as truth into these things I have been told, would be appreciated.

42021,42021,ReQovery,oueq11,1,47,DragonflyFinal,abuse from mods,"this is concerning abuse i have recieved from mods on the sister subreddit to this one, i see now that the same mod in question is a mod here too so i expect nothing to change but I still hope that another mod may see this and realize there's an issue. I have been a good faith member of the community from the beginning and have been harassed and attacked and now banned, in each case because the mods falsely convinced themselves that i was a right wing troll. One can only wonder about how many other good-faith users have been falsely banned from contributing to the community due to the paranoid delusions of an ex-anon.

original thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/oucvk2/qmom\_has\_been\_drinking\_mms\_chlorine\_dioxide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/oucvk2/qmom_has_been_drinking_mms_chlorine_dioxide/)

this person posted about their mother drinking some sort of bleach chemical  as a preventative for covid. When confronted about the dangers of these  chemicals her response was ""no they're not dangerous."" That seemed childish to me, so I made a joke about her being a child: ""some children  simply wont take no for an answer and have to touch the hot stove, hopefully she grows out of it as she matures."" I have a friend who complained about the relentless depressing nature of the sub, and so I thought making a joke would help lighten the mood a bit.

i  was swiftly permanently banned despite being a good faith member of the sub since this account was created and posting there often. That definitely confused me so I replied asking why I was banned for making a  harmless joke. First response i got:

&gt;Oh fuck off, dont fence with me, ""Oh she'll be right hopefully"" get the hell outta herePretending  to give advice whilst secretly hoping things continue so  that someone  you hate dies, are you serious? Do you really think we're  that stupid?So dumb

I  didn't know what to make of this reply, it was so out of touch with reality. I literally made a joke, none of that other stuff ever entered my mind nor do i condone it, and months of posting history in that sub  is proof of that, but whatever.

So i simply replied:

&gt;wow, you are unhinged. the woman was acting like a child, so i called her a child. i spent about 2 seconds thinking about it

100% genuine truth.

after muting me from replying, they followed that up with

&gt;that's funny, so did i

so there you have it folks, a mod of a support community bragging about banning someone without even thinking about it. It's actually crazy that they see it as a good thing and not a bad thing, they used it as their mic drop moment lmao.

The  really strange thing is that this mod decided this was worthy of a  permanent ban and not simply deletion of the comment. To me that really  speaks to their deep need to feel powerful, and shows that the good of  the community has nothing to do with it since a look through my history  would show i've been a massively positive contribution to the sub. Then again, the mod in question is a guy whose flair on the sub is literally ""ex-qanon."" Maybe it's just me, but putting an ex anon in charge of a support forum for those hurt by qanon  seems like a terrible idea. You can see their conspiratorial mind still  working, desperately trying to find a deeper meaning in my message with  which to justify my ban, acting as if i'm some deep-cover right wing  troll intent on destabilizing the whole subforum with my lame jokes. This is clearly exemplified in their first reply when they say, ""do you really think **we're** that stupid?"" implying that i was not also a contributing member of the sub for many months.

What's  even more disappointing is that this isn't even the first time I've  been harassed by the mods of that subreddit. Several months back when  the lab-leak theory of covid was still not allowed to be spoken of, i  mentioned it in there and then i had some mod temp ban me and get all in my dm's saying they were going to be watching me from now on and the  mods were going to discuss me and they would probably ban me and blah blah blah, it went on for several messages and was rather disturbing  since i was just a normal person trying to use the subreddit for its  intended purpose. After i reported those dm's for harassment, they all  disappeared and my temp ban was reversed, of course i was not given any  apology or explanation from anyone.

It's  rather concerning that such an important support group which regularly  features in national news outlets is actually being run by aggressive  harassers and qanons.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/oueq11/abuse_from_mods/,/r/ReQovery/comments/oueq11/abuse_from_mods/,1.0,2021-07-30 05:43:17
42022,42022,ReQovery,ovg106,1,16,ricketycricketspcp,"For Visibility: Update regarding ""Abuse From Mods""","We've decided to post the updates as their own post to increase visibility. The same information can be found pinned on the original post.

Okay, it's been a long day, and we've finally come to a conclusion. Before we get into all of this, the mods would like to remind everyone to avoid any kind of behavior that could be considered harassment or brigading, including of individuals and subreddits involved in this situation.

The full reasoning behind the ban and the conclusions of the investigation are contained within [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qBk6DncZ42O3XZ-DK6XxisZa7bHbvOy5/view?usp=sharing). I will summarize the key findings and add some personal notes on the interactions referenced in the OP. So to start off, it is the opinion of the moderators on both subs that [Dragonfly's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/oucvk2/qmom_has_been_drinking_mms_chlorine_dioxide/h71jn6x/?context=3) taken on its own warranted a ban. If it had only been this comment, the ban would have been temporary. It should be understood that r/qanoncasualties and ReQovery are support groups, and joking about a person's loved one being hurt or dying is simply unacceptable. We have very little tolerance for this kind of behavior. But, despite what Dragonfly may say, it is the larger *pattern* of behavior over a long period of time that got them a permanent ban. Relevant details can be found in the linked document, including screenshots of offending comments.

The beginning of this pattern of behavior began clear back in February of this year. At that time, they were given a warning. Dragonfly refers to this warning as ""harassment."" It seems they want to have their cake and eat it too. They don't think they should be banned for joking about a redditor's family member's death, but they also claim that it is harassment if we simply warn them that their behavior may lead to a ban. But I digress. The behaviors leading to the ban include:

* **Consistently advising members of the sub to cut off their friends and family**
* Generally being unsupportive in a support group
* Consistently posting comments that do not belong on the sub, but which instead belong better on r/Qult_Headquarters
* **Promoting meta-conspiracy theories about the QAnon conspiracy theory** (that QAnon was started by Trump, his administration, the CIA or the Russian government). Needless to say, promoting conspiracy theories is *against the rules*
* **And making light of and normalizing death and suggesting people should die**

Taken as a whole, not only should this user have received a permanent ban, they should have been banned a long time ago. This user was warned by the mods clear back on the 23rd of February. The user took this warning as ""harassment."" A mod note was made at that time that if their behavior remained the same, they should be banned.

Finally, I would like to address the modmail and recent interactions between this user and the mod team. To be clear, the response from the moderator was unnecessary. In addition, if these subs are to have a rule about civility, then the mods should be expected to behave civilly in modmail. This is an issue that is being addressed by the mod team. However, this response didn't happen in a vacuum, and I think the evidence already shown shines some light on why the mod in question reacted the way they did. But for even more context I believe it should be known that the mod team has been dealing with repeated waves of abuse in modmail, bad faith posters, ban evaders and, perhaps most importantly, waves of brigaders. The mod in question has *specifically* been the target of many of these brigades, as well as the target of harassment, bullying and abuse. The cumulative affect of this is that our mods, including and perhaps the mod referenced especially, have been on edge. Still, if the sub members are expected to behave civilly, then so should the mods. We are addressing this.

In conclusion: OP's ban stays. The pattern of behavior, going back months now, consistently shows that they are unwilling to abide by the subreddit rules, of which they have broken several. The mod team has been under a lot of stress from dealing with bad faith actors, harassment and brigaders, but we are committed to responding more civilly, even when someone genuinely deserves a ban, and even when they refuse to extend the same common courtesy of civility.

From the second update:

As an additional update, we would like to let everyone know that we have received word from the admins that [Dragonfly is a ban evader](http://imgur.com/gallery/N3mLPx4) conneced to at least three other accounts.

You may have noticed that we hinted that this might be the case, and we have now received confirmation that it is so. The originally banned account was a user who told us that they would make us pay and that ""bans don't work."" They also accused a mod of not going go college for some reason.

Given that Dragonfly has been here for several months and these other accounts were banned previously, I am confident that this person is part if the brigades that were mentioned. This user has been managing several accounts to infiltrate the subreddit, and like other brigaders they have taken to harassing and bullying our XQ mod.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/ovg106/for_visibility_update_regarding_abuse_from_mods/,/r/ReQovery/comments/ovg106/for_visibility_update_regarding_abuse_from_mods/,1.0,2021-07-31 22:04:01

Within the first year of my life, I saw planes crash into the world trade center and the Pentagon. When I was 7 years old, the financial markets around the world collapsed. My dad lost his business and became depressed as a result. My first year of high school, a fascist was elected president of the United States of Ameirca. My graduation was cancelled because of a global pandemic. My prom was cancelled because of a global pandemic. My first year of college was shut inside because of a global pandemic. Despite being vaccinated and despite taking every goddamn precaution I now am required to wear masks again all so that conspiracy theorists and qultists who DID NOT GET VACCINATED EVEN THEOUGH THEY VERY EASILY COULD HAVE don't get sick. Of course I'll do it, I'm not a selfish psychopath. This means my second year of college will likely be dominated with covid stuff because old Karen who saw some minion memes on Facebook decided that vaccines are the spawn of hell. That is 1/2 of my college career and 3 years total.

America has been going downhill since I was born. I grew up during the war on terror. I can now fight in a war that started a few months after I was born (though it seems to be coming to an end now, so that's good). 

The climate is heating up and I will have to live in a world of floods and extreme weather.

And you know what I hear when I am at home? You know what I have to deal with? ""California droughts are caused by geo engineering!!!"" ""Biden is a sex trafficker!!"" ""Trump was chosen by god! He's the best president ever and he'll be reinstated!""

I have seen fascists storm the capitol building of the United States of America because they were driven by q lunacy. Vivid has continued because of q lunacy.  Democracy itself is in danger because of q lunacy. My LGBT friends, my asian friends (my own adopted sister from China) are at a higher risk. Why? Q lunacy and right wing conspiracies.

And yet all I hear is about how conservatives and qultists are the real victims.

Look, I'm pissed off. Really pissed off. And I am running very very low on sympathy for qultists. They praise authoritarians and dictators like Putin and Kim. They worship a man who sought to make America his own authoritarian state. And they claim to love freedom while pointing guns at protestors.

Do you understand why many of us who have lost people to the qult are angry? I'm not sad, I'm fucking furious. And I know many people were scared and looking for answers so they turned to the qult, I objectively know that. But at the same time, y'all help keep a fascist in power. You actively supported authoritarianism and attacks on democracy itself. That's not ok. I'm not going to sugar coat. That is what the qult did. And now young people like me have to deal with the consequences. I'll likely have to spend a great deal of my life fighting authoritarianism in the republican party.

I know this was a bit ranty, but frankly I am angry. And I need you guys to understand why. And to remember this when talking to people you cut out of your lives. My mom is still deep into this stuff. She is supporting a literal military coup overthrowing a democratic process. That's not ok. I'm sorry but it isn't.

I would like to be more sympathetic and to understand how and why you became so detached from reality. But even if I do understand even if I do have sympathy, I'll still be angry.

42034,42034,ReQovery,p0b3h1,1,3,Neodnyarri,A follow-up to a previous post if this is the right place to do it.,"Hi. So I posted this thread a while back on the main sub ([https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/osn7k7/dealing\_with\_the\_aftermath\_of\_being\_lied\_to\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/QAnonCasualties/comments/osn7k7/dealing_with_the_aftermath_of_being_lied_to_for/)) about 11 days ago or something and I feel like things have improved. Seeing as this is affiliated to it in some manner I thought maybe sharing some of the ways things improved might help other people dealing with similar issues to mine. And also vent about some new stressors in my life since I don't have anywhere else and don't wanna put this on my friends who are also struggling quite a lot. Apologies in advance for the walls of text, I'm just really bad at articulating myself and am just sorta stream-of-consciousness writing this. And uh, sorry for not responding to messages and mails or whatever. It feels really difficult to talk to people one on one like that, but I did read them and I appreciate them.

I wasn't in the right state of mind when I posted that thing, reading the stories on that sub just brought back so many painful memories and I couldn't really help myself. My dog had also died earlier that week because he had cancer and couldn't feel his back legs, and to top it all off I was dealing with harassment in another community. Just a string of unfortunate events happening for multiple months and I had hit my limit. So apologies for seeming dramatic or overly emotional. I ended up kinda breaking down to my FC mates in FFXIV about it and a few people I trust in my RP community as well after that thread which was cringy**.** But I think getting it off my chest has helped quite a lot. Talking to my now fiancee (is that the right word?) about it was the right decision, they've helped me deal with a lot of the stress and emotions that were boiling over at that moment. I've also gone back to journaling again to try to take things I don't wanna think about out of my head and it has helped me cope a bit. It might seem dumb but its gotten me through some rough times, give it a try even if you think it won't work. 

Speaking of FFXIV, it's a very welcoming and LGBT-friendly community(the primal data center had an in-game pride parade on pride month it was pretty cool). I'm a gamer so I spend a lot of time on it. The positivity really helps. Even if it sounds cringy and cliche to say, just giving people compliments or saying thank you goes a really long way which is obvious but I think it needs to be re-iterated. If you need a game to help cope with stuff or get some escapism then it's really good for that. 

On another note, I wanted to talk about a stressor giving me a lot of grief. Covert redpillers, bad actors, cult recruiters, and those types. I run and moderate a discord and forum RP community(under a different name), and part of the reason that initial breakdown that led to the post happened was because there's usually people who get on my case when I ban those types from my community who don't have the lived experience or haven't done the research to understand why these types need to go. Maybe this is giving too much information but at the time I had just banned someone for ""just asking questions"". You know, the free speech absolutist type who isn't actually free speech and just wants a reason to try and slip the JQ to people on the down-low. I had warned them and told them to drop it but they went on the usual censorship and echo chamber tirade. And people were yelling at me because I wouldn't allow a discussion and legitimize the thought that these things are discussion-worthy at all.

It's so exhausting, it feels like these people never stop coming. And worse, I'm constantly getting criticized by people who don't understand and refuse to take an explanation because I'm not good at articulating myself and don't know how to debate. I do understand that this is basically an abusive relationship but I love this community and I do not want it to die like every other community I've been a part of. And I get the idea of ""you should help yourself before you help others"" or that I should maybe take a break if its so stressful but see previous. I don't know what to do, it feels like I'm just trapped with this thing that stresses me the fuck out under threat of losing the community I love. It's affecting my writing and RP quality and people are starting to notice.

Anyway that's about it. I just wanna thank people again for commenting on my previous post and giving me feedback even if I probably wouldn't have posted it were I not losing my mind a little at the time. It has helped a lot with dealing with the guilt thing, I've felt pretty bad about it for like 2 years so I'm glad it's dealt with. And to the other people recovering from similar manipulation and abuse, I hope sharing my experiences and what worked for me can help you along the way.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/p0b3h1/a_followup_to_a_previous_post_if_this_is_the/,/r/ReQovery/comments/p0b3h1/a_followup_to_a_previous_post_if_this_is_the/,1.0,2021-08-08 08:38:04

Now. Let me start by saying I’m a fairly strong leaning conservative. But I also have some left leaning views. My best friend and I have been friends for 5 years. And over the last year he has went so far down this rabbit hole of Qanon and other crazy conspiracy theories. Don’t get me wrong I believe there’s some truth in what they have said. Pedo gate is definitely a real thing, but nothing like what they make it out to be. And I have my own doubts about the solidarity of our election process this last time around. But I know that without factual evidence. It’s nothing but a crazy thought. all these other completely illogical things they say is just insane. I don’t want my friend to be completely brainwashed. Is there any really credible sources that have done any researching or refuting of the whole Qanon cult ideology? Any links/ sources you have that I can try to show him that this is a little wacky would be awesome. Thanks I’m advance! And before you say it no. I will not just turn my back on my friend. At the end of the day I won’t let a difference in beliefs tear my friendship apart. But I would like to show him that he can’t believe everything that has “John mcafee” or “Qanon” in the name of the title.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/p39p3e/losing_a_friend/,/r/ReQovery/comments/p39p3e/losing_a_friend/,1.0,2021-08-12 21:47:15
42038,42038,ReQovery,p3p2e9,1,69,musical_pharmacist22,"Q was a nightmare, trying to save family","Thought I would share my story. I am a pharmacy student about to graduate next year. I am a practicing Catholic and my core values align with the Catholic Church, but I am pretty moderate on other issues and am open to other people's opinions. My family is mostly conservative but some are more like me, and some are definitely far right.

My story starts after the 2020 election. Most of us voted for Trump. A lot of my family would watch fox, but after the election they switched to Daily Wire, The Epoch Times, Church Militant, and The Remnant (Catholic news that represents very far right fringe ideas). We all believed that the election was stolen, or at the very least, there were a lot of questions that still needed to be answered with the counting process. Some of my family believed that it was the ""end of America"" and we would all be doomed and there was no one coming to save us. In December 2020, I started reading their new choices of news sources, and I firmly believed all they said and that there would be a ""storm"" coming that would overturn the results. I would read Twitter feeds, then after the Twitter purge, found Gab and Telegram and started reading feeds from there (though I had no account, I could easily access them). I watched videos including X22, And We Know, Praying Medic, Jordan Sather, Charlie Ward, Mel K, and many others. From this I started believing all sorts of conspiracies (ex. body doubles/clones, satanic pedophiles, economic collapse, return of Trump, etc.). I believed that this was the ""truth"" that the media was ""hiding"" from us.

I kept this a secret from my family. They had no idea that I was reading and watching what I was. I had gotten into periods where I was obsessed over news before, but nothing at all like this. It consumed my day, pretty much 75% of my waking hours were spent reading feeds and watching videos. It was amazing I did as well as I did in my classes because Q pulled me away from studying. Q even pulled me away from watching the Daily Mass sometimes.

In May, things started to change. I was going to be getting my COVID vaccine. As I was very vaccine hesitant at the time, I did not get it when most of my classmates did, I chose to wait for a bit and see how my classmates did. However, as a pharmacy student, I trust the medical community and what they have to say, and rejected the anti-vax conspiracies such as microchips or altering DNA. I hated how much COVID has become politicized on both sides of the spectrum. But my mom fell into the conspiracies about microchips or aborted fetuses from her news sources. Most of my family was vaccinated but my mom was convinced the vaccine was a sin. I showed her some of the more mainstream Catholic news sites (that she has rejected now) that said otherwise and she reluctantly agreed to get Moderna. This was what got me to start pulling away from Q. By June, I had quit watching videos and reading Gab.

I was only on Telegram feeds and they were much harder to give up until I had an epiphany in July. I realized that I was being duped. QAnon is basically a big cult. They would shut down or block any opinion that was even slightly different from them (really ironic, because they think that ""they,"" the government, want to do the same thing). They would call people ""sheeple"" or ""shills,"" harass them, and even give death threats or threats of violence. I realized that they were contrary to Catholic teachings and to what Jesus taught, to love God and love our neighbor. Instead, these people are hateful and want to oppress other people while claiming that they are oppressed themselves. I could not stand to be part of a group that just hated people like that. Q made me unhappy, distressed, and fearful about my future. I went through a weird cycle of hope and fear and I had nightmares, panic attacks, and trouble sleeping. For 7 months, I was mentally the worst I had ever been.

Since July, I have been completely Q free. I don't even listen to Charlie Kirk or Candace Owens or Turning Point USA who I loved (while not Q, they have embraced some viewpoints lately, related to the vaccine, that I strongly disagree with). I may come back to them later, but right now I am sticking to local news to get my news fix. I am strongly pro-vax and think masks should be the new norm in nursing homes, hospitals, and public transit. I still believe in Catholic values, though I no longer consider myself ""far right"" like I used to, as I said above there are a lot of things I am more moderate on now. My mental health is the best it has ever been.

I still have not told my family about this because I am nervous about what they will say. No one even knows that I am posting my story on here. I want to help them and save them from the same nightmare that I went through. But some of them might be too far gone.

I am so mad at QAnon and all associated with it because they have only sought to divide people and hurt relationships. I wish it would just go away and all of my family would be normal again.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/p3p2e9/q_was_a_nightmare_trying_to_save_family/,/r/ReQovery/comments/p3p2e9/q_was_a_nightmare_trying_to_save_family/,0.99,2021-08-13 16:50:23

Plus, I don't shut myself off from any side. I'll listen to what anyone has to say, even the town idiot. Doesn't mean I'll believe any of it, but Im always down to listen to contrasting views. I've heard the Patriots, Communists, Socialists, Religious, Democrat, Republican etc views on matters.

Ultimately, being a student of history I realized Q was a scam, and a blatant but updated copy of Operation Trust, a Soviet Psyop used against Royalist Russians. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation\_Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Trust)

I also become disillusioned with Donald Trump, sure he was entertaining but from my perspective, but it came to the point where despite the claims of being some ""4D Chess Master"" it became clear to me he was either an incompetent fool or a part of the globalists he often complained about. Either way, both things were unacceptable to me. 

Naturally, this put me at odds with my once fellow compatriots, many arguments later, and lost friendships, I stayed the course, because the truth above all else is important to me, no matter where it leads. 

Of course, this is the part that may be hard for people to hear, but I stand by it as the truth after hundreds of hours of research and actually speaking to sources within the Government and Military.

Nothing is clear cut, black and white. The truth ends up somewhere in the middle. Democrats/Republicans, are really just two sides of the same coin. They both lie, they both put their Swiss bank accounts above the good of the people. Really, society is being re-arranged so that no lives matter except Wealthy Elite lives.  These divisions were created through massive manipulation of the public, using Q lies and fake news. 

I've spent months lurking, around these Qanon forums, and I've seen the comments and something striking about it all, is the other side quite literally feels the same way this side feels.  They too feel the left are brainwashed extremists, out to destroy them and their lives, and take away their rights. Its so bizzare just how when boiled down past the politics the grievances on both sides come to the same feelings.

Its a known fact intense sustained stress and fear create Mass Psychosis and both sides are made to be terrified for various reasons, add in all the lies being spoken on both sides and toss in lives being torn apart and you have the perfect storm for a population to descend into madness and delusions.

Conspiracy theories have always been something lodged in the back of my mind, not unlike a brain tumor. In some cases it will flare up and ill try to connect all the dots and go down the rabbit holes so thoughtfully laid out by its designers. The rabbit holes of conspiracy theories are designed as an entrapment device. Created and utilized by malign forces for malicious purposes i won't share my thoughts on who it benefits or why that is (ever hear this one? ""Do your own research"" 😉) but I can say that this pandemic of misinformation is arguably worse than any physical virus because its symptoms include the corruption of the victims mind. The subscription to these theories includes such benefits as paranoia, anxiety, depression, violence, mistrust, and, if gone unchecked, potentially the destruction of civil life. When I think about how these ideas have not only harmed me personally but those who have fallen victim to them, those with mental illness or tendencies of paranoia, people close to me, and people affected by the rise of far right extremism globally, my mind has always been drawn to this biblical quote. The fruits of the tree of conspiracy are mental decay and suffering and the liberation thereof bring relief. The world is not as corrupt as you have been told, only your mind. As with any extremist death cult you have been given many anxieties and dreaded consequences for leaving. Whether that's being sent to hell, being killed or tracked by a vaccine, or being a brainwashed sheep, they dont want you to leave because they have designed this rats maze for you get lost in for their benefit. Find the source if the corruption and liberate yourself of its rotten fruits.

42052,42052,ReQovery,pk5ifm,1,117,sbgmi,Regrettably vaccinated - looking for some reassurance,"
Hi all, have read some of the previous posts and found them quite helpful already. Guess I’m hoping for some more specific advice. 

I’ve pretty much lost my entire family to Q. They were already quite conspiratorial before Q came along, so I’ve always grown up with a level of conspiracy in my household and as a result there’s some stuff that I subscribe to. For the sake of relevance these include a general scepticism of government and their corruption, the idea of the military industrial complex, medical industrial complex, etc. I don’t even think the ones listed here are conspiratorial. They’re quite well documented phenomena. 

I don’t subscribe to Q or the more recent conspiracies. But I get absolutely bombarded by posts, bitchute videos and anecdotes of how people have had adverse reactions to vaccines and how this is all a means to reduce the global population through illness and infertility. I’m living with a household of scientists currently, one who even works in drug safety, but nothing they’ve said has helped alleviate some of the anxiety I’m feeling. They look at the stats at the expense of anecdotal evidence. As someone who sees sexism in medicine and how male bias can cause issue for women’s health, the widespread stories of people having irregular periods is something of concern to me. The scientists I know dismiss this and say it’s being looked into - but my question is why haven’t vaccinations been halted for people that menstruate until there’s some certainty on the matter. 

Additionally, there was a whole back and forth recently where the British government was going to go against scientific advice to vaccinate 12-15 year olds. If they’re so safe, why are kids not being vaccinated? If this is an example of how science keeps government in check, what are the instances where they have failed to do so? 

I haven’t told my family that I have been vaccinated (it would cause so much stress) - and so they keep sending me information so that I don’t get vaccinated. My parents recently sent an entire novels worth of words about how I don’t need to give into the pressure, how I should stand strong against tyranny etc. As someone who was very hesitant, it makes me feel awful that I’ve “given into” the jab when I was unsure and that I’m continually lying to everyone. While I can’t stop lying (family members have told me they’re losing hair and their health is suffering over the stress of the thought of me getting vaccinated) I want to release this awful unease that I’ve done something wrong and that I will develop an awful disease/health condition over the next few years. 

As I said, reading the posts below have definitely helped. I’d really appreciate some further advice/words of wisdom. Thank you to anyone who has read this far.",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/pk5ifm/regrettably_vaccinated_looking_for_some/,/r/ReQovery/comments/pk5ifm/regrettably_vaccinated_looking_for_some/,1.0,2021-09-08 07:05:38

It felt awful, but at the same time I couldn't stop, I kept coming back to it and I could feel a rush of dopamine connecting the nonexistent dots, while knowing that deep down it didn't all make much sense. I eventually snapped out of it when I realized I was ruining my life, but a lot of the thoughts and conclusions and the drive itself remained, and I still feel the urge to go back and dive in once again, I don't feel completely out of it all yet, and I'm having trouble fully leaving it all behind, it's very stressful but I'm making an effort, it feels like I'm going through withdrawal.

42057,42057,ReQovery,ps04ma,1,42,selfawareprotagonist,I feel guilty every time I think about trying to take care of my own health,"My parents are both q-adjacent and heavily antivax. They’ve been antivax ever since I was probably about 7 (I’m 21 now), and they have instilled me with a fear of getting any sort of treatment for anything. 

Two years ago, I got a UTI and had to get antibiotics. My mom made me ask the doctor to let her into the appointment so she could tell the doctor that she didn’t want me taking some antibiotic that may have a side effect of paralysis (I’m not really sure if this is true, my mother fearmongers a lot whether she realizes it or not). She told the doctor to prescribe me something else, which ended up being resistant to the infection. When the doctor called me to prescribe something else, I felt like I had to ask for my mommy’s permission to take a different antibiotic. I called my mom to tell her I was getting something else and she said “Let me research it first”. 

Now that Covid-19 is running rampantly through the world, I’m terrified to do anything without them knowing or finding out. I went to get tested today because I have a cough (it feels like it’s mostly allergies) and I tested negative. I still feel guilty about getting tested because my parents were trying to convince me the swab tests have metal or poison on the tips. About an hour after I got it, my mom sent me a text saying “This is why I don’t want you to do the swab test. If you need to get tested I will take you” and sent a video of a “registered nurse” talking about why she thinks the swab tests are dangerous. I didn’t tell my mom anything about getting tested today. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about how I’ll be able to get vaccinated without my family’s insurance being billed and them finding out. They probably won’t throw me out if I got vaccinated, but they would absolutely bombard my body with things like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and huge doses of vitamins to “detox” my body. I feel like I’m being poisoned by them, mentally and physically with the unproven treatments they already shove onto me.

I’m scared that this will highly impact how I make medical decisions for myself and my loved ones in the future. I want to have kids someday but I know I have a budding fear about what my parents will say if I vaccinate them. Does anyone have any advice on how to get out of this way of thinking and this fear of medicine/sickness?",True,self.ReQovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReQovery/comments/ps04ma/i_feel_guilty_every_time_i_think_about_trying_to/,/r/ReQovery/comments/ps04ma/i_feel_guilty_every_time_i_think_about_trying_to/,1.0,2021-09-20 17:58:37
