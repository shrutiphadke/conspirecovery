Stacked data is not science, even a person as wholly devoted to this scam like yourself would admit that it was amazing that the temperature record utilised to reflect the UK was slightly lower than todays period temperatures and yet they were cultivating wine. This is clearly inconsistent with the temperatures required in that region and thus, he got what he wanted and stopped looking to actually validate his results.\\n\\n\\nIt is sloppy and inconsistent with the scientific method and highlights the sham that is your chosen career. Yamal data was inconsistent except for the magic 63, MWP existed and to a greater extent claimed by Mann and he is wrong. You know he is wrong, the Pope knows he was wrong and Mann knows he was wrong. \\n\\n\\nLove the lies claim. Always with misrepresentations and then accusations against the person you are arguing with, Classic Alinsky and also a clear indicator of a tactic employed when you are LOSING the argument. Willie Soon is right, regardless of his sources, Mann is wrong regardless of who agrees with him. \\n\\n\\nNo go away and write up an article on how global warming is causing lag in computer games or some other impossible claim. By the way, King Arthur chopped off the Black Knights limbs. No shooting involved, like everything else you have posted, you have wrapped a big lie in a small truth and claimed victory. When you stop lying, you may actually be able to do some science rather than the poor regurgitation of failed hacks.   \n",

It means that we keep investigating.\\n\\n&amp;gt; Climate scientists however apply it externally by transposing their fixed attitude externally.\\n\\nI presume you base this on some study of their science, and are not just making it up on the spot because it suits your world-view.\\n\\nPlease point me to the study where this was investigated. I'm quite interested in philosophy of science.\\n\\n&amp;gt; Climate science's unique ability is manipulation: of the media, of politicians, of scientific organizations, of people of good will.\\n\\nWhat mechanisms do you think, say John T. Houghton manipulates media, politicians and scientific organisations?\\n\\nAnd did James Hansen pick up the ability to manipulate scientific organisations when he moved from studying Venus' atmosphere to studying Earth's?

But in all these acres of electronic coverage, one hugely relevant point about these thousands of documents has largely been missed.\\nThe reason why even the Guardian's George Monbiot has expressed total shock and dismay at the picture revealed by the documents is that their authors are not just any old bunch of academics. Their importance cannot be overestimated, What we are looking at here is the small group of scientists who have for years been more influential in driving the worldwide alarm over global warming than any others, not least through the role they play at the heart of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\\nProfessor Philip Jones, the CRU's director, is in charge of the two key sets of data used by the IPCC to draw up its reports. Through its link to the Hadley Centre, part of the UK Met Office, which selects most of the IPCC's key scientific contributors, his global temperature record is the most important of the four sets of temperature data on which the IPCC and governments rely – not least for their predictions that the world will warm to catastrophic levels unless trillions of dollars are spent to avert it.\\nDr Jones is also a key part of the closely knit group of American and British scientists responsible for promoting that picture of world temperatures conveyed by Michael Mann's \"hockey stick\" graph which 10 years ago turned climate history on its head by showing that, after 1,000 years of decline, global temperatures have recently shot up to their highest level in recorded history.\\nGiven star billing by the IPCC, not least for the way it appeared to eliminate the long-accepted Mediaeval Warm Period when temperatures were higher they are today, the graph became the central icon of the entire man-made global warming movement.\\nRelated Articles\\n* \\t\\tEuro 2012 11 Jun 2012\\n* \\t\\t'Climategate' university performs data U-turn 28 Nov 2009\\n* \\t\\tClimategate won't make global warming go away 29 Nov 2009\\n* \\t\\tCopenhagen climate summit: Doors open on summit 07 Dec 2009\\n* \\t\\tClimate emails sweep America 29 Nov 2009\\n* \\t\\tBBC weatherman was sent climate change emails 30 Nov 2009\\nSince 2003, however, when the statistical methods used to create the \"hockey stick\" were first exposed as fundamentally flawed by an expert Canadian statistician Steve McIntyre , an increasingly heated battle has been raging between Mann's supporters, calling themselves \"the Hockey Team\", and McIntyre and his own allies, as they have ever more devastatingly called into question the entire statistical basis on which the IPCC and CRU construct their case.\\nThe senders and recipients of the leaked CRU emails constitute a cast list of the IPCC's scientific elite, including not just the \"Hockey Team\", such as Dr Mann himself, Dr Jones and his CRU colleague Keith Briffa, but Ben Santer, responsible for a highly controversial rewriting of key passages in the IPCC's 1995 report; Kevin Trenberth, who similarly controversially pushed the IPCC into scaremongering over hurricane activity; and Gavin Schmidt, right-hand man to Al Gore's ally Dr James Hansen, whose own GISS record of surface temperature data is second in importance only to that of the CRU itself.\\nThere are three threads in particular in the leaked documents which have sent a shock wave through informed observers across the world. Perhaps the most obvious, as lucidly put together by Willis Eschenbach (see McIntyre's blog Climate Audit and Anthony Watt's blog Watts Up With That ), is the highly disturbing series of emails which show how Dr Jones and his colleagues have for years been discussing the devious tactics whereby they could avoid releasing their data to outsiders under freedom of information laws.\\nThey have come up with every possible excuse for concealing the background data on which their findings and temperature records were based.\\nThis in itself has become a major scandal, not least Dr Jones's refusal to release the basic data from which the CRU derives its hugely influential temperature record, which culminated last summer in his startling claim that much of the data from all over the world had simply got \"lost\". Most incriminating of all are the emails in which scientists are advised to delete large chunks of data, which, when this is done after receipt of a freedom of information request, is a criminal offence.\\nBut the question which inevitably arises from this systematic refusal to release their data is – what is it that these scientists seem so anxious to hide? The second and most shocking revelation of the leaked documents is how they show the scientists trying to manipulate data through their tortuous computer programmes, always to point in only the one desired direction – to lower past temperatures and to \"adjust\" recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming. This comes up so often (not least in the documents relating to computer data in the Harry Read Me file) that it becomes the most disturbing single element of the entire story. This is what Mr McIntyre caught Dr Hansen doing with his GISS temperature record last year (after which Hansen was forced to revise his record), and two further shocking examples have now come to light from Australia and New Zealand.\\nIn each of these countries it has been possible for local scientists to compare the official temperature record with the original data on which it was supposedly based. In each case it is clear that the same trick has been played – to turn an essentially flat temperature chart into a graph which shows temperatures steadily rising. And in each case this manipulation was carried out under the influence of the CRU.\\nWhat is tragically evident from the Harry Read Me file is the picture it gives of the CRU scientists hopelessly at sea with the complex computer programmes they had devised to contort their data in the approved direction, more than once expressing their own desperation at how difficult it was to get the desired results.\\nThe third shocking revelation of these documents is the ruthless way in which these academics have been determined to silence any expert questioning of the findings they have arrived at by such dubious methods – not just by refusing to disclose their basic data but by discrediting and freezing out any scientific journal which dares to publish their critics' work. It seems they are prepared to stop at nothing to stifle scientific debate in this way, not least by ensuring that no dissenting research should find its way into the pages of IPCC reports.\\nBack in 2006, when the eminent US statistician Professor Edward Wegman produced an expert report for the US Congress vindicating Steve McIntyre's demolition of the \"hockey stick\", he excoriated the way in which this same \"tightly knit group\" of academics seemed only too keen to collaborate with each other and to \"peer review\" each other's papers in order to dominate the findings of those IPCC reports on which much of the future of the US and world economy may hang. In light of the latest revelations, it now seems even more evident that these men have been failing to uphold those principles which lie at the heart of genuine scientific enquiry and debate. Already one respected US climate scientist, Dr Eduardo Zorita, has called for Dr Mann and Dr Jones to be barred from any further participation in the IPCC. Even our own George Monbiot, horrified at finding how he has been betrayed by the supposed experts he has been revering and citing for so long, has called for Dr Jones to step down as head of the CRU.\\nThe former Chancellor Lord (Nigel) Lawson, last week launching his new think tank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation , rightly called for a proper independent inquiry into the maze of skulduggery revealed by the CRU leaks. But the inquiry mooted on Friday, possibly to be chaired by Lord Rees, President of the Royal Society – itself long a shameless propagandist for the warmist cause – is far from being what Lord Lawson had in mind. Our hopelessly compromised scientific establishment cannot be allowed to get away with a whitewash of what has become the greatest scientific scandal of our age.\\nChristopher Booker's The Real Global Warming Disaster: Is the Obsession with 'Climate Change' Turning Out to be the Most Costly Scientific Blunder in History?

       "5066     &gt; The mistake alarmists make again and again is to take peer-reviewed paper as exact facts.\\n\\nReally.\\n\\nCan you point out a few examples of this?\\n\\n&gt; Making a prediction about what an apple will do once released, that's based on preconception\\n\\nIf it's done by a football player, perhaps. But we're talking about scientists. The prediction is made from a understanding of the theory of gravitation. Preconception doesn't come into it.\\n\\n&gt; Pick any. Motion of the planets, evolution, plate tectonics, ... .\\n\\nThe motion of the planets is a science? Who are some living motion of the planets scientists?\\n\\nI'll take evolution. Point me to where evolutionary biologists have shown that their field is internally consistent.\\n\\nAnd that's neither here nor there, because we know that there is no consistent theory of the physics of forces and motion. But just because Relativity is inconsistent with quantum dynamics, it doesn't mean that we don't believe in gravitation or the colour force. It means that we keep investigating.\\n\\n&gt; Climate scientists however apply it externally by transposing their fixed attitude externally.\\n\\nI presume you base this on some study of their science, and are not just making it up on the spot because it suits your world-view.\\n\\nPlease point me to the study where this was investigated. I'm quite interested in philosophy of science.\\n\\n&gt; Climate science's unique ability is manipulation: of the media, of politicians, of scientific organizations, of people of good will.\\n\\nWhat mechanisms do you think, say John T. Houghton manipulates media, politicians and scientific organisations?\\n\\nAnd did James Hansen pick up the ability to manipulate scientific organisations when he moved from studying Venus' atmosphere to studying Earth's?

       "2161715  &gt; I find it odd that \"Peer reviewed\" is the magic line that must be crossed to gain the climate-alarmist-stamp-of-approval, alarmists consistently write off sketpical arguments by asking for peer reviewed work, and then when such work is produced apparently it doesn't matter anyway...\\n\\nYou might have missed it, but this paper has not (yet) been peer reviewed. It is in fact now in \"open review\": people can post comments on the journal webpage, and the authors and editors can respond to them. Once this process is finished, there is a decision on whether the final paper will be published there.\\n\\nPersonally, I think it's quite interesting. It's however also quite irrelevant for the question of the general Hockeystick because we know that (i) the uptick in the Hockeystick primarily originates in the instrumental data and not in the proxy data, and (ii), we get the same Hockeystick from virtually all proxies, you can safely throw away everything that has ever been done with treerings if you're worried about their accuracy.\\n\\n

       "2163604  &gt;Oh come on. Surely you can read \"the country’s consumer surcharge to fund renewable electricity would rise by about 8 percent\" next year and as an Alarmist, you must know all scary predictions are made for the year 2100.\\nSimple arithmetic says that tax will be 44.17 euros by 2100 at this alarming rate of 8% a year. You guys predict 50 foot sea level rises and 17 degree temperature rises by 2100; I just want to participate in the same game Alarmists enjoy playing.\\n\\nYeah I got the joke. Thanks for explaining it anyways, makes it oh so much funnier.\\n\\nSeriously though, at least throw in some scenarios a la IPCC.\\n\\n&gt;What benefit is there regarding the current climate paradigm, in raising the cost of electricity? Who stands to gain and who stands to lose?\\n\\nThat's an interesting question. Look into lack of competition arguments, and the fact that 75% of the electricity bill has nothing to do with EEG, and how industrial electricity price slump affects EEG.\\n\\nThough it could all be a mass conspiracy of making energy savings and energy efficiency a priority. In that case the EEG is insufficient of course. *raises hands*

       "2168758  \\n\\nClimategate exposed !!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Christopher Booker\\n6:10PM GMT 28 Nov 2009\\n\\nA week after my colleague James Delingpole , on his Telegraph blog, coined the term \"Climategate\" to describe the scandal revealed by the leaked emails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit, Google was showing that the word now appears across the internet more than nine million times. But in all these acres of electronic coverage, one hugely relevant point about these thousands of documents has largely been missed.\\nThe reason why even the Guardian's George Monbiot has expressed total shock and dismay at the picture revealed by the documents is that their authors are not just any old bunch of academics. Their importance cannot be overestimated, What we are looking at here is the small group of scientists who have for years been more influential in driving the worldwide alarm over global warming than any others, not least through the role they play at the heart of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\\nProfessor Philip Jones, the CRU's director, is in charge of the two key sets of data used by the IPCC to draw up its reports. Through its link to the Hadley Centre, part of the UK Met Office, which selects most of the IPCC's key scientific contributors, his global temperature record is the most important of the four sets of temperature data on which the IPCC and governments rely – not least for their predictions that the world will warm to catastrophic levels unless trillions of dollars are spent to avert it.\\nDr Jones is also a key part of the closely knit group of American and British scientists responsible for promoting that picture of world temperatures conveyed by Michael Mann's \"hockey stick\" graph which 10 years ago turned climate history on its head by showing that, after 1,000 years of decline, global temperatures have recently shot up to their highest level in recorded history.\\nGiven star billing by the IPCC, not least for the way it appeared to eliminate the long-accepted Mediaeval Warm Period when temperatures were higher they are today, the graph became the central icon of the entire man-made global warming movement.\\nRelated Articles\\n* \\t\\tEuro 2012 11 Jun 2012\\n* \\t\\t'Climategate' university performs data U-turn 28 Nov 2009\\n* \\t\\tClimategate won't make global warming go away 29 Nov 2009\\n* \\t\\tCopenhagen climate summit: Doors open on summit 07 Dec 2009\\n* \\t\\tClimate emails sweep America 29 Nov 2009\\n* \\t\\tBBC weatherman was sent climate change emails 30 Nov 2009\\nSince 2003, however, when the statistical methods used to create the \"hockey stick\" were first exposed as fundamentally flawed by an expert Canadian statistician Steve McIntyre , an increasingly heated battle has been raging between Mann's supporters, calling themselves \"the Hockey Team\", and McIntyre and his own allies, as they have ever more devastatingly called into question the entire statistical basis on which the IPCC and CRU construct their case.\\nThe senders and recipients of the leaked CRU emails constitute a cast list of the IPCC's scientific elite, including not just the \"Hockey Team\", such as Dr Mann himself, Dr Jones and his CRU colleague Keith Briffa, but Ben Santer, responsible for a highly controversial rewriting of key passages in the IPCC's 1995 report; Kevin Trenberth, who similarly controversially pushed the IPCC into scaremongering over hurricane activity; and Gavin Schmidt, right-hand man to Al Gore's ally Dr James Hansen, whose own GISS record of surface temperature data is second in importance only to that of the CRU itself.\\nThere are three threads in particular in the leaked documents which have sent a shock wave through informed observers across the world. Perhaps the most obvious, as lucidly put together by Willis Eschenbach (see McIntyre's blog Climate Audit and Anthony Watt's blog Watts Up With That ), is the highly disturbing series of emails which show how Dr Jones and his colleagues have for years been discussing the devious tactics whereby they could avoid releasing their data to outsiders under freedom of information laws.\\nThey have come up with every possible excuse for concealing the background data on which their findings and temperature records were based.\\nThis in itself has become a major scandal, not least Dr Jones's refusal to release the basic data from which the CRU derives its hugely influential temperature record, which culminated last summer in his startling claim that much of the data from all over the world had simply got \"lost\". Most incriminating of all are the emails in which scientists are advised to delete large chunks of data, which, when this is done after receipt of a freedom of information request, is a criminal offence.\\nBut the question which inevitably arises from this systematic refusal to release their data is – what is it that these scientists seem so anxious to hide? The second and most shocking revelation of the leaked documents is how they show the scientists trying to manipulate data through their tortuous computer programmes, always to point in only the one desired direction – to lower past temperatures and to \"adjust\" recent temperatures upwards, in order to convey the impression of an accelerated warming. This comes up so often (not least in the documents relating to computer data in the Harry Read Me file) that it becomes the most disturbing single element of the entire story. This is what Mr McIntyre caught Dr Hansen doing with his GISS temperature record last year (after which Hansen was forced to revise his record), and two further shocking examples have now come to light from Australia and New Zealand.\\nIn each of these countries it has been possible for local scientists to compare the official temperature record with the original data on which it was supposedly based. In each case it is clear that the same trick has been played – to turn an essentially flat temperature chart into a graph which shows temperatures steadily rising. And in each case this manipulation was carried out under the influence of the CRU.\\nWhat is tragically evident from the Harry Read Me file is the picture it gives of the CRU scientists hopelessly at sea with the complex computer programmes they had devised to contort their data in the approved direction, more than once expressing their own desperation at how difficult it was to get the desired results.\\nThe third shocking revelation of these documents is the ruthless way in which these academics have been determined to silence any expert questioning of the findings they have arrived at by such dubious methods – not just by refusing to disclose their basic data but by discrediting and freezing out any scientific journal which dares to publish their critics' work. It seems they are prepared to stop at nothing to stifle scientific debate in this way, not least by ensuring that no dissenting research should find its way into the pages of IPCC reports.\\nBack in 2006, when the eminent US statistician Professor Edward Wegman produced an expert report for the US Congress vindicating Steve McIntyre's demolition of the \"hockey stick\", he excoriated the way in which this same \"tightly knit group\" of academics seemed only too keen to collaborate with each other and to \"peer review\" each other's papers in order to dominate the findings of those IPCC reports on which much of the future of the US and world economy may hang. In light of the latest revelations, it now seems even more evident that these men have been failing to uphold those principles which lie at the heart of genuine scientific enquiry and debate. Already one respected US climate scientist, Dr Eduardo Zorita, has called for Dr Mann and Dr Jones to be barred from any further participation in the IPCC. Even our own George Monbiot, horrified at finding how he has been betrayed by the supposed experts he has been revering and citing for so long, has called for Dr Jones to step down as head of the CRU.\\nThe former Chancellor Lord (Nigel) Lawson, last week launching his new think tank, the Global Warming Policy Foundation , rightly called for a proper independent inquiry into the maze of skulduggery revealed by the CRU leaks. But the inquiry mooted on Friday, possibly to be chaired by Lord Rees, President of the Royal Society – itself long a shameless propagandist for the warmist cause – is far from being what Lord Lawson had in mind. Our hopelessly compromised scientific establishment cannot be allowed to get away with a whitewash of what has become the greatest scientific scandal of our age.\\nChristopher Booker's The Real Global Warming Disaster: Is the Obsession with 'Climate Change' Turning Out to be the Most Costly Scientific Blunder in History?

The only ones who seem to be denying that are the Warmists.

It represented a scenario in which nothing ever happened to slow the growth of CO2 emissions from what it was during the 70s and 80s.\"\\n**THAT HAPPENED in  ACTUALITY BUT WORSE, The GHGs were higher than Hansen theorized**\\n\\nWhy wouldn't we use the projected temperature increase for that scenario to compare to actual temperature increases? As it was the increase in temperature was twice as high as actual measured temperature.\\n\\nHansen also had a fudge factor built in He had calculated a major volcanic eruption in 2014. That did not happen. However calculating it i reduced Scenario A's temperature projection.\\n **TWICE AS MUCH AS REALITY**.  You need to quit arguing before I throw you entirely under the bus.\\n\\nFurthermore the 2017 end date is one that is essentially cherry picked because it is the endpoint where an enso event causes a large excursion upwards to allow alarmists to claim that Scenario B was met. When in fact if the trend rate is measured it can be seen that the temperature per the trend is much lower.\\n\\n Second, applying a post-hoc bias correction to the forcing ignores the fact that converting GHG increases into forcing is an essential part of the modeling. ESSENTIAL PART OF THE MODELING.\\n\\n If it was not included to begin with then the modeling was shit. The Scenario that most closely matches reality was Scenario C.\\n\\nLooked at another way, Scenario A has a slope (post 1988) of about 0.033 while the observed temperatures have a slope of about 0.017. Twice the warming predicted. And that prediction was arbitrarily low due to the missing volcanic eruption and 2. the actual temperatures were measured at a high point in the sinusoidal curve of the normal ups and downs of the temperature measurements. 3. The actual GHGs were higher by 25% than Hansen postulated.\\n\\nNow do we want to go down the Coulda Woulda Shoulda path in describing the results of the study? I can name 3 different **VALID REASONS** that the projections would be further off in opposition to your assertions. .</td>\n",

It's a way of economically reversing history and giving \"developing nations\" the ability to run the world for the next couple of hundred years instead of the ones in charge now.\\n\\nChina already emits more than 30% of the CO2 emissions on the planet.  According to the Climate Alarmists, the US, the EU, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and a few others must reduce our emissions by 80% or the world will die horribly.  But, it's okay for China to double their emissions while we cut ours by more than half.  It's a given that India and Brazil will double their emissions, too.  \\n\\nLet's say that we cut our emissions back by half, and they double theirs.  We will trade places with China, where they are emitting more than 16 Tons per capita while we will emit under 8, but they have 4 times the number of people.  They will emit 8 times the amount of GHGs that the US does at that point.  But, the alarmists don't want us to drop to half, they want us to drop to 20% of our 2005 levels.  That would put us at about half the level, per capita, that India emits now.\\n\\nDoes the world win? No.  All that happens here is that we lose.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Water vapor is a GHG. in fact, 95% of the GHG effect is due to water vapor.  My quick and dirty take on this is that we, by increasing the atmosperic concentration of CO2, have caused the atmosphere's GHG concentration to go from about 1% to about 1.01%  Notice, for example, how when relative humidity goes from 30% to 31%, every plant around you dies and the rivers all dry up?  And when it goes to 100%, all the glaciers melt away, and polar bears go extinct?  \\n\\nThe GHG H20 can go from 1% to 1.5% fairly easily. We see it all the time.  All the IR escaping to space has to traverse 50% more GHGs to get out, and clearly an increase of 50% would cause a warming effect of many degrees C, which then causes more evaporation and more warming, due to the positive feedbacks. \\n\\nOr, maybe, just maybe... the lower atmosphere is already completely saturated, and adding more GHGs has very little effect?  If a CO2 molecule, way up above the clouds, releases an IR photon downwards, does it not have to make it back through all of the completely saturated lower atmosphere before it can hit the surface and warm us up further?\\n\\nBut, I'm an ignorant data scientist. What do I know?  I'm sure the alarmists are right, and we're all doomed.</td>\n",

It represented a scenario in which nothing ever happened to slow the growth of CO2 emissions from what it was during the 70s and 80s.\"\\n**THAT HAPPENED in  ACTUALITY BUT WORSE, The GHGs were higher than Hansen theorized**\\n\\nWhy wouldn't we use the projected temperature increase for that scenario to compare to actual temperature increases? As it was the increase in temperature was twice as high as actual measured temperature.\\n\\nHansen also had a fudge factor built in He had calculated a major volcanic eruption in 2014. That did not happen. However calculating it i reduced Scenario A's temperature projection.\\n **TWICE AS MUCH AS REALITY**.  You need to quit arguing before I throw you entirely under the bus.\\n\\nFurthermore the 2017 end date is one that is essentially cherry picked because it is the endpoint where an enso event causes a large excursion upwards to allow alarmists to claim that Scenario B was met. When in fact if the trend rate is measured it can be seen that the temperature per the trend is much lower.\\n\\n Second, applying a post-hoc bias correction to the forcing ignores the fact that converting GHG increases into forcing is an essential part of the modeling. ESSENTIAL PART OF THE MODELING.\\n\\n If it was not included to begin with then the modeling was shit. The Scenario that most closely matches reality was Scenario C.\\n\\nLooked at another way, Scenario A has a slope (post 1988) of about 0.033 while the observed temperatures have a slope of about 0.017. Twice the warming predicted. And that prediction was arbitrarily low due to the missing volcanic eruption and 2. the actual temperatures were measured at a high point in the sinusoidal curve of the normal ups and downs of the temperature measurements. 3. The actual GHGs were higher by 25% than Hansen postulated.\\n\\nNow do we want to go down the Coulda Woulda Shoulda path in describing the results of the study? I can name 3 different **VALID REASONS** that the projections would be further off in opposition to your assertions. .   \n",

       "1075614  This is because they know this isn't about CO2.  It's about punishing the Western Developed Nations for being economically superior 100 years before the other nations.  It's a way of economically reversing history and giving \"developing nations\" the ability to run the world for the next couple of hundred years instead of the ones in charge now.\\n\\nChina already emits more than 30% of the CO2 emissions on the planet.  According to the Climate Alarmists, the US, the EU, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and a few others must reduce our emissions by 80% or the world will die horribly.  But, it's okay for China to double their emissions while we cut ours by more than half.  It's a given that India and Brazil will double their emissions, too.  \\n\\nLet's say that we cut our emissions back by half, and they double theirs.  We will trade places with China, where they are emitting more than 16 Tons per capita while we will emit under 8, but they have 4 times the number of people.  They will emit 8 times the amount of GHGs that the US does at that point.  But, the alarmists don't want us to drop to half, they want us to drop to 20% of our 2005 levels.  That would put us at about half the level, per capita, that India emits now.\\n\\nDoes the world win? No.  All that happens here is that we lose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "185205   Water vapor is a GHG. in fact, 95% of the GHG effect is due to water vapor.  My quick and dirty take on this is that we, by increasing the atmosperic concentration of CO2, have caused the atmosphere's GHG concentration to go from about 1% to about 1.01%  Notice, for example, how when relative humidity goes from 30% to 31%, every plant around you dies and the rivers all dry up?  And when it goes to 100%, all the glaciers melt away, and polar bears go extinct?  \\n\\nThe GHG H20 can go from 1% to 1.5% fairly easily. We see it all the time.  All the IR escaping to space has to traverse 50% more GHGs to get out, and clearly an increase of 50% would cause a warming effect of many degrees C, which then causes more evaporation and more warming, due to the positive feedbacks. \\n\\nOr, maybe, just maybe... the lower atmosphere is already completely saturated, and adding more GHGs has very little effect?  If a CO2 molecule, way up above the clouds, releases an IR photon downwards, does it not have to make it back through all of the completely saturated lower atmosphere before it can hit the surface and warm us up further?\\n\\nBut, I'm an ignorant data scientist.
